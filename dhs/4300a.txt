 ...................................................................................................3  A DHS 
Component 
is any organization which reports directly to the 

Office of the Secretary (includ
ing the Secretary, the Deputy Secretary, the 
Chief of Staffs, Counselors, and staff, when approved as such by the 

Secretary), including both Operational Components and Support 

Components (also known as Headquarters Components). [Source

applications, because of the information they contain,
 however, require 

special management oversight and should be classified as MAs. An MA is 

distinguishable from a GSS by the fact that it is a discrete application, 

whereas a GSS may support multiple applications. Each MA must be 

under the direct oversight o
f a Component CISO or Information System 

Security Manager (ISSM), and must have an ISSO assigned.

 1 1.0 INTRODUCTION
 This 
Hand
book serves
 as the f
oundation 
on which 
Department of Homeland Security (
DHS) Components 
are to 
develop
, build, 
and implement 
their 
information security programs
; it provide
s specific techniques and procedures for implementing the requirements of the DHS 
Information Security Program
 for Sensitive Systems
, and 
for 
meet
ing
 the Programs 
Baseline 
Security 
Requirements (BLSR)
, which 
are generated by the DHS 
information
 security policies 
published in 
DHS Sensitive Systems Policy Directive 4300A
.  Components must 
address these 
BLSRs 
when 
developing and maintaining information
 for 
their 
security documents.
 This 
Handbook 
contains a compilation 
of 
DHS Component 
best practices 
that adhere to DHS 
Information Technology (
IT) security policies and 
meet 
requirements contai
ned in various 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) publications, Office of Management and 

Budget (OMB) direction, and Congressional and Executive mandates
.  The scope and contents of this handbook will 
be updated
 as new capabilities are a
dded to DHS 

systems, as security standards are upgraded, and as 
user experience
s and needs change.
 This handbook 
addresses 
only 
information security and 
is issued as implementation guidance 

under the authority of the DHS Chief Information Officer (CIO) thr
ough the Office of the DHS 
Chief Infor
mation Security Officer (CISO)
. The a
spects 
of 
information security 
covered 
by this Handbook 
are comprehensive; they 
pertain 

to 
personnel, physical, information, and industrial security; investigations; emergency 

prepa
redness; and domestic counterterrorism
.  Additional information will be published by 
the 
proponents of 
these programs
.   1.1 Information Security Program
 and Implementation Guidelines
 The DHS Information Security Program provides 
the
 baseline of policies, stan
dards, and 
guidelines for DHS Components
.  This 
Handbook
 provides direction to managers and senior 
executives for managing and protecting sensitive systems
.  The sections in this Handbook are 
numbered parallel to the pertinent sections of DHS Sensitive Sys
tems Policy Directive 4300A, 
where specific requirements and responsibilities are given.  
 This Handbook pertains to DHS Sensitive Systems as distinct from DHS National Security 

Systems
 (NSS)
.  All DHS National Security Systems must use
 the guidance provid
ed in the DHS 
National Security Systems Policy Directive 4300B series, dated, April 19, 2013, which are 

available on the DHS CISO website.  The 4300B series applies to all DHS elements, employees, 

contractors, detailees, others working on behalf of DHS, an
d users of DHS NSS that collect, 

generate, process, store, display, transmit, or receive Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret 

classified national security information.  The DHS National Security Systems Policy Directive 

4300B series documents are
 available 
on the DHS CISO website.
 Policy elements are effective when issued.  Any policy element
 that 
has not been implemented 
within ninety (90) days 
is considered a weakness and either a system or program Plan of Action 
and Milestones (POA&M) must be generated by
 the Component for the identified weaknesses
.  When 
the 
Policy Directive is changed, the CISO will ensure that appropriate 
tool changes are 

made available to the Department within
 forty
-five (45) days
 of the changes.

 Overview
 This Handbook provides guidance that 
for implementing
 the following controls required by DHS 
policy:
  Management Controls
  These controls f
ocus on managing both system information 
security controls and system risk. 
These controls consist of risk mitigation techniques 
normally 
used 
by management.
  Operational Controls 
 These controls f
ocus on mechanisms primarily implemented and 
executed by people
.  Operational 
controls are designed to improve the security of a partic
ular 
system or group of systems and often rely on management and technical controls.
  Technical Controls 
 These controls f
ocus on security controls executed by information 
systems
.  Technical
 controls provide automated protection from unauthorized access o
r misuse
; facilitate detection of security violations
; and support security requirements for 
applications and data.
  Privacy Controls
  DHS privacy controls have been added to DHS information security 
policy documents to comply with the publication of NIST 
Special Publication (
SP) 800-53, Rev.4, Appendix J: Privacy Control Catalogue. The privacy controls focus on information 

privacy as a value distinct from, but highly interrelated with, information security. Privacy 

controls are the administrative, technica
l, and physical safeguards employed within 
organizations to protect and ensure the proper handling of 
Personally Identifiable 

Information (
PII
). DHS 4300A SENSITIVE

 Essential functions
 are those 
that enable Executive Branch agencies to provide vital services, 
exercise civil authority, maintain the safety and 
well
-being
 of the general populace, and sustain 
industrial
 capability and the national 
econom
y base during an emergency.
 1.4.6 Federal Information Security 
Modernization 
Act 
of 2014
 (FISMA)
 The Federal Information Security Management Act (
FISMA
) requires each agency t
o develop, 
document, and implement an agency
-wide information security program 
that will 
provide a high
-level of security for the information and information systems support
ing
 the operations and 
assets of the agency, including those provided or managed by
 another agency, contractor, or 
other source
.   FISMA requires 
that 
the CIO designate a senior agency information security official 
to develop 
and maintain a Department
-wide information security program
.  The designees r
esponsibilities 
include:
  Developing
 and maintaining information security policies, procedures, and control 
techniques 
that address all applicable requirements
  Training and overseeing personnel with significant information security 
responsibilities 
  Assisting senior Department officials 
with
 respect to 
their responsibilities under the 
statute

the 

Department
s compl
iance 
with the 
statute
 and related policies, procedures, standards, 
and guidelines
  Ensuring that the Departme
nt CIO, in coordination with other senior Department 
officials, reports annually to the 
Secretary
 on the effectiveness of the Department
s information security program, including 
the 
progress of remedial actions
 1.4.7 Foreign Intelligence Information
 This type o
f information relates to the capabilities, intentions, and activities of foreign powers, 

organizations, or persons, but does not include counterintelligence 
(CI) 
except for information on 

international terrorist activities.
 1.4.8 General Support System
 (GSS)
 A general support system
 (GSS) is an interconnected set of information resources 
that share 
common functionality and are 
under the same direct management control
.  A GSS normally 
includes hardware, software, information, applications, communications, data and
 users
.  Examples of GSS include local area network
s (LAN), 
including smart terminals that support a 
branch office, Department
-wide backbone
s, communications network
s, and
 Departmental data 
processing center
s including 
their
 operating system
s and utilities
. Note: 
Security for GSS
s in use at DHS Headquarters 
is under the oversight of the DHS Office of 
the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), with support from the DHS 
Security
 Operations Center 
(SOC)
.  All other GSS
s are
 under the direct oversight of respective 
Component CISOs, with 
support from the Component
s SOC
.  Every
 GSS must have an Information Systems Security 
Officer (ISSO) assigned.

 5 1.4.9 Information Technology
 (IT)
 Division E of the 
Information Technology Management Reform Act of 
1996
,  Public Law 104
-106, commonly referred to as t
he Clinger
-Cohen Act
 of 1996, 
defines 
Information 
Technology 
(IT) as 
 any equipment or interconnected system or subsystem of equipment that is used 
in the automatic acquisition, storage, manipulation, management, movement, 
control,
 display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or 

information by an Executive agency.
 For purposes of the preceding definition, equipment refers to that used by any DHS 

Component or contractor, if the contractor requires the use of
 such equipment in the performance 
of a service or the furnishing of a product in support of DHS.
 The term 
information technology
 includes computers, ancillary equipment, software, firmware, 
and similar procedures, services (including support services), an
d related resources.
 The term 
information system
 as used in this policy document, is equivalent to the term 
IT system
. 1.4.10 Major Application
 (MA)
 A major application 
(MA) is an 
Automated 
Information 
System (AIS) that OMB Circular A
-130 defines as requiring s
pecial attention to security due to the risk and magnitude of harm 
resulting from the loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to or modification of the information in 
the application. 
 1.4.11 All Federal applications require some level of protection. Certain applic
ations, 

because of the information they contain, however, require special management 

oversight and should be classified as MAs. An MA is distinguishable from a GSS by 
the fact that it is a discrete application, whereas a GSS may support multiple 

applicatio
ns. Each MA must be under the direct oversight of a Component CISO or 
Information System Security Manager (ISSM), and must have an ISSO assigned.

 The 
Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Preve
ntion Act of 2004
 (IRTPA), 
(Public Law 108
-458, 118 Stat. 3662) amended the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 401a) to provide the 

following definition:
 (5) The terms national intelligence and intelligence related to national 
security refer to
 all intelligence, regardless of the source from which derived and 
including information gathered within or outside the United States, that
 (A) pertains, as determined consistent with any guidance issued by the President, 

to more than one United States Go
vernment agency; and
 (B) that involves
 (i) threats to the United States, its people, property, or interests;
 (ii) the development, proliferation, or use of weapons of mass destruction; or
 (iii) any other matter bearing on United States national or homelan
d security.

 6 1.4.13 Personally Identifiable Information
 (PII)
 Personally Identifiable Information
 (PII) 
means information that permits the identity of an 
individual t
o be directly or indirectly inferred, including other information that is linked or 
linkable to an individual regardless of whether the individual is a United States citizen, legal 

permanent resident, or a visitor to the United States.
  [See
 also Sensitive
 Personally Identifiable 
Information (SPII)]
  Examples of PII include, but are not limited to:  
  Name
  date of birth
  mailing address
  telephone number
  Social Security number (SSN)
  email address
  zip code
  account numbers
  certificate/license numbers
  uniform re
source locators 
(URLs)
  static Internet protocol addresses
  biometric identifiers such as 

fingerprint
  voiceprint
  iris scan
  photographic facial images
  PII also includes 
any other unique identifying number or characteristic, and any information 
where it is r
easonably foreseeable that the information will be linked with other information to 
identify the individual.
 1.4.14 Privacy Sensitive System
 A Privacy Sensitive System
 is any system that collects, uses, disseminates, or maintains PII or 
Sensitive PII.
 1.4.1 Privileged 
User
 A privileged user
 is a user that is authorized (and therefore, trusted) to perform security
-relevant 
functions that ordinary users are not authorized to perform.
 (Source:  NISTIR 7298 rev 2.0
) 1.4.2 Public Information
 This type of information can be disclos
ed to the public without restriction but requires protection 
against erroneous manipulation or alteration (e.g., 
public 
website
s).
 1.4.3 Sensitive Information
 Sensitive Information is any information, which if lost, misused, disclosed, or, without 
authorization
 is accessed, or modified, could adversely affect the national or homeland security 

interest, the conduct of Federal programs, or the privacy of individuals, but which has not been 

specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order or
 an Act of Congress to 
be kept secret in the interest of national defense, homeland security or foreign policy.

 2 Specific e
xamples of sensitive information include
, in addition to the examples given under PII 
and SPII, the following:
  trade secr
ets
  system vulnerability information
  pre
-solicitation procurement documents, such as statements of work
  information pertaining to law enforcement investigative methods
 Detailed reports related to computer security deficiencies in internal controls are also
 sensitive 
information because of the potential damage that could be caused by the misuse of this 
information
.  System vulnerability information about a financial system 
is considered Sensitive 
Financial Information
.   All 
sensitive information must be pro
tected from loss, misuse, modification, and unauthorized 
access.
 With the exception of certain types of information protected by statute (e.g. Sensitive Security 

Information, Critical Infrastructure Information), there are no specific Federal criteria and 
no 
standard terminology for designating types of sensitive information. Such designations are left to 

the discretion of each individual Federal agency. For Official Use Only (FOUO) is the term 

used within DHS to identify unclassified information of a sen
sitive nature that is not otherwise 

categorized by statute or regulation. DHS will adopt the term Controlled Unclassified 

Information (CUI) at a later date.
 1.4.4 Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information
 (SPII)
 Sensitive Personally Identifiable Informatio
n (SPII)
 is a subset of PII
 [see definition above]
, which if lost, compromised or disclosed without authorization, could result in substantial harm, 

embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to an individual.  Some forms of PII are sensitive 

as stand
-alo
ne elements.  Examples of such 
stand alone 
PII 
elements 
include: Social Security 
numbers (SSN), drivers license or state identification number, Alien Registration Numbers (A
-number), financial account number, and biometric identifiers such as fingerprint,
 voiceprint, or 

iris scan.  
 Additional examples of SPII include any groupings of information that contain an individuals 
name or other unique identifier plus one or more of the following elements:
  Truncated SSN (such as last 4 digits)
  Date of birth (mont
h, day, and year)
  Citizenship or immigration status
  Ethnic or religious affiliation
  Sexual orientation
  Criminal History
  Medical Information
  System authentication information such as mothers maiden name, account
 passwords 
or P
ersonal 
Identification 
Numbers
 (PIN)
 Other PII may be sensitive depending on its context, such as a list of employees and their 

performance ratings or an unlisted home address or phone number.  In contrast, a business card 

or public telephone directory of agency employees contains PI
I but is not sensitive.

 3 1.4.5 Sensitive System
 A sensitive system
 is any combination of facilities, equipment, personnel, procedures, and 
communications that is integrated for a specific purpose, and that may be vulnerable to an 
adversarial attack by an advers
ary seeking to violate or disrupt the systems confidentiality, 
integrity, or availability.
  1.4.6 Strong Authentication
 Strong authentication
 is 
a method used to secure computer systems and/or networks by verifying 
a users identity by requiring two
-factors in 
order to authenticate (something you know, 
something you are, or something you have).  Typically, strong authentication requires 
authenticators that are resistant to replay attacks and employ multifactor authentication. Strong 

authenticators include, for e
xample, PKI where certificates are stored on a token protected by a 
password, passphrase, or biometric.
  [See the discussion of Level 4 assurance in 
NIST SP 800
-63-2, Electronic Authentication Guideline,
 (August 2013)]
 1.4.7 Trust Zone
 A Trust Zone
 consists of 
any combination of 
people, information resources, data systems, and 
networks 
that are 
subject to a shared security policy (
a set of rules governing access to data an
d services)
.  For example, a Trust Zone may be set up between different network segments that 
require specific usage policies based on information processed, such as law enforcement 

information.
 1.4.8 Two
-Factor Authentication
 The classic paradigm for authentica
tion systems identifies three factors as the cornerstone of 
authentication: 
  Something you know 
(for example, a password or Personal Identification Number 
(PIN) 
  Something you have 
(for example, an ID badge or a cryptographic key) 
  Something you are 
(for e
xample, a fingerprint or other biometric data) 
 The strength of authentication systems is largely determined by the number of factors 
incorporated by the system. Implementations that use two factors are considered to be stronger 

than those that use only on
e factor.  A requirement for two of the three factors listed above 

constitutes two factor authentication.
 1.4.9 Visitor
 A guest or temporary employee who presents themselves or is presented by a sponsor, for entry 
for less than 6 months to a secured facility th
at is not their primary work location.
  (Source:  
DHS Lexicon)
 The visitor is placed in 
one of 
two categorizes,
 either
 escort required
 or no escort required
. Escort required
 visitors are escorted at all times. 
No escort required
 visitors 
are
 granted limite
d general access to the facility without an escort. Escort procedures for classified areas are 

indicated in Management Directive 11051 SCIF Escort Procedures.

 4 1.4.10 Vital Records
 Vital records
 are 
Electronic and hardcopy documents, refe
rences, databases, and information 
systems needed to support essential functions under the full spectrum of emergencies
.  Categories of 
vital
 records may include:
  Emergency operating records
  emergency plans and directive(s)
; orders of succession
; delegat
ions of authority
; staffing assignments
; selected program records needed to continue 
the most critical agency operations
; and 
related policy or procedural records.
  Legal and financial rights 
records
  records that 
protect the legal and financial rights of 
the 
Government and of the individuals directly affected by its activities
.  Examples include 
accounts receivable records, social security records, payroll records, retirement records, and 
insurance records
.  These records were formerly defined as 
rights
-and-interests records.
  Records used to perform national security preparedness functions and activities 
in 
accordance with Executive Orders (EO).
 1.5 Waivers 
 Components may request waivers to any portion of 
the requirements of DHS Sensitive Systems 
Policy
 Dire
ctive
 4300A when
 they are unable to fully comply with 
a Policy 
Directive 
requirement
.  Waiver r
equests are 
routed
 through the Components ISSO for the system to the 
Components CISO
 or 
ISSM, and then to the DHS CISO
.  All submitters 
are to
 coordinate with 
the 
Authorizing Official (
AO) prior to submission
.   If a material weakness is reported in an audit report, and the weakness is not scheduled 
for
 remediat
ion
 within twelve (12) months, the Component must submit a waiver request to the DHS 
CISO
.  If the mat
erial weakness is 
in 
a financial system, the Component Chief Financial Officer 
(CFO) must also approve the waiver request before sending to the DHS 
CISO
.   If the material weakness exists in a system processing PII, the Component Privacy Officer or 

Privacy
 Point of Contact (PPOC) and DHS Chief Privacy Officer must also approve the waiver 
request before sending to the DHS CISO. 
 An approved waiver does not bring the system into compliance with policy; it is an 

acknowledgement by the DHS CISO of the systems 
non-compliance with policy and that an 
acceptable plan to remediate the weakness has been provided and compensating controls have 

been implemented. 
In all cases
, waivers 
are to
 be requested for an appropriate period based on a 
reasonable remediation strate
gy.
 1.5.1 Waiver Requests
 The Waiver Request Form 
found
 in Attachment B of the 
DHS 4300A
 Sensitive Systems 
Handbook
 is used
 to request waivers from 4300A Policy requirements.  
 Component ISSOs, audit liaisons, and others may develop the waiver request, but the S
ystem 
Owner submit
s the request through the Components CISO/ISSM
.  All waiver requests ae 
coordinated with the AO prior to submission.
 Waiver requests 
are to
 include 
documentation of mission impact as 
operational justification
; mission impact, risk accept
ance
; risk mitigation measures
; and a POA&M for bringing the 
system procedures or control weakness into compliance
.   DHS 4300A SENSITIVE 
SYSTEMS 
HANDBOOK
  v12.0, November 15, 2015
 5 Any waiver requests for 
financial s
ystems must be submitted to and approved by the 
Components CFO prior to submission to the DHS CISO
.  Any waiver 
request for
 Privacy 
Sensitive Systems must be submitted to and approved by the Components Privacy Officer or 
senior Privacy Point of Contact (PPOC) prior to being submitted to the DHS CISO.
 Any waiver for 
compliance with privacy controls 
must be
 submitted to and approved by the 
DHS 
Chief Privacy Officer
. All approved waiver requests must be directed through the Components CISO/ISSM who will 

in turn direct 
them 
to the DHS CISO.
 1.5.2 Requests for Exception to 
U.S
. Citizen
ship Requirement
 Special proced
ures apply for exception to the requirement that persons accessing DHS systems 
be U.S. 
citizens
.  Under normal circumstances, only U.S. 
citizens are allowed access to DHS 
systems and networks; 
but there is a need 
at times to grant access to foreign nationa
ls.  Access 
for foreign nationals is normally a long
-term commitment, and exceptions to 
citizenship 
requirements 
are treated 
differently 
from 
security policy 
waivers.  
Exceptions to the U.S. 
citizenship requirement should be requested by completing a Forei
gn National Visitor Access 
Request, DHS Form 11052
-1, which is available online or through the DHS Office of the Chief 
Security Officer (OCSO).  Components who have access to the DHS OCSO Integrated Security 

Management Systems (ISMS), Foreign National Vet
ting Management System (FNVMS) may 
file their requests in that manner. For further information regarding the citizenship exception 

process, contact the DHS OCSO at

. 1.6 Digital and 
Other Electronic Signatures
 Pursuant to Sections 1703 and 1705 of the Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA), 
OMB Memorandum M
-00-10, Procedures and Guidance on Implementing of the Government 
Paperwork Elimination Act
 requires executive agencies to 
provide the option for electronic 
maintenance, submission, and disclosure of information when practicable as a substitute for 

paper, and to use and accept electronic signatures.
 Electronic signatures are essential in the Departments business processes and
 IT environments; 
reducing reliance on paper transactions improves information sharing, strengthens information 

security, and streamlines business processes, while reducing both cost and environmental impact. 
 Please refer to the 
DHS Electronic Signature Policy Guidance document
 for guidance on 
electronic signature policy
 It should be noted that certain policy 
requirements 
appl
y to both di
gital signatures 
and other signature methods, while 
other policy requirements 
apply only to digital 
signatures.  This is made clear in Sensitive Systems Policy Directive 4300A Sections 
1.6.1 and 1.6.2.
 1.7 Information Sharing
 The DHS 
SOC
 exchanges information 
with Component SOCs, Network Operations Centers 
(NOC), the Homeland Secure Data Network (HSDN) SOC, the Intelligence Community, and 
with external organizations in order to facilitate the security and operation of the DHS network.  

This exchange enhances si
tuational awareness and provides a common operating picture to 
network managers.  The operating picture is developed from information obtained from raw 
DHS 4300A SENSITIVE 
SYSTEMS 
HANDBOOK
  v12.0, November 15, 2015
 6 fault, configuration management, accounting, performance, and security data.  This data is 
monitored, 
collected, analyzed, processed, and reported by the NOCs and SOCs.
 The DHS 
SOC
 is responsible for communicating other information such as incident reports, 
notifications, vulnerability alerts and operational statuses to Component SOCs, Component 
CISOs/ISSM
s and other identified Component points of contact.
 The DHS 
SOC
 portal implements role
-based user profiles that allow Components to use the 
websites incident database capabilities.  Users assigned to Component groups 
are to
 be able to 
perform actions such
 as:
  Entering incident information into the DHS 
SOC
 incident database
  Generating preformatted incident reports
  Initiating queries of the incident database
  Viewing FISMA incident reporting numbers
  Automating portions of the Information Security Vulnerabilit
y Management (ISVM) 
program
  Automating portions of the vulnerability assessment progr
am 1.8 Threats
 Emphasis on e
-Government has added the general public to the class of Government computer 
users and has transferred the repository for official records from pap
er to electronic media.
 Information systems are often connected to different parts of an organization; interconnected 

with other organizations systems; and with the Internet.  Remote access for telecommuting and 

building management services 
including but 
not limited to 
badge systems; heating, ventilating, 

and air
-conditioning (HVAC); and entry may require additional connections, all of which 
introduce additional risks.
 Wireless 
mobile 
systems such as cell 
phones
 and 
pagers allow personnel to stay in touch 
with 
their offices and wireless local area networks (WLAN) permit connection from various locations 
throughout a building.  While these technologies provide greater flexibility and convenience, 

they also introduce additional risks.
 As technologies continue
 to converge, (cell phones with Internet access, walkie
-talkie 
communications, and video; low cost Voice over Internet Protocol [VoIP]; copiers that allow 
network printing; printing over the Internet; and facsimile [fax] functions) operating costs are 

redu
ced, making 
their implementation 
tempting
; but each of these technology advancements 
contains inherent security risks and presents challenges to security professionals.
 1.8.1 Insider
 Threats
 Managers are generally aware of natural and physical threats, such as e
arthquakes, tornadoes, 
fires, floods, electric outages, and plumbing disasters, but may not have the same level of 
awareness regarding disasters or threats originating from within their organizations.  The threat 

from DHS users should not be underestimated
.  Sensitive data can be lost, corrupted, or 

compromised through malicious or careless acts.  A malicious user can intentionally cause harm 
to the Departments reputation and data.  Uninformed or careless users can inflict similar 

damage.
 DHS 4300A SENSITIVE 
SYSTEMS 
HANDBOOK
  v12.0, November 15, 2015
 7 Converging techno
logies combine the vulnerabilities of the individual technologies, so care must 
be taken to ensure that systems are designed with no single points of failure.  (For example, if the 

building HVAC were connected to the data network it would become necessary 
to ensure that an 

outage or attack on the HVAC would not also cause a network outage.)
 1.8.2 Criminal Threats
 Malicious code remains a threat to DHS systems.  Malware and those who employ it have 

become very sophisticated; malicious code can be tailored to the r
ecipient.  This code can be 
transferred to an unsuspecting users machine by various means, including email, visiting 

infected websites, or across a network.  These capabilities may be used to steal, alter, or destroy 

data; export malicious code to other s
ystems; add backdoors that would permit access to data or 
network resources; or prevent the legitimate use of the individual computer or network service.
 Instructions for exploiting hardware or software vulnerabilities are often available on hacker sites 

within hours of discovery.  Skilled hackers routinely target e
-commerce sites to obtain credit 
card numbers.  Persons with hacking skills are often hired to perform espionage activities.
 1.8.3 Foreign Threats
 Foreign Governments routinely conduct espionage activi
ties to obtain information that will be 
useful to their own industrial/government base and operations.  They also have the resources to 
disrupt Internet communications and 
have launched successful 
cyber
-attacks
. Eavesdropping on w
ireless 
communications 
wit
h commercially available equipment
 is common;
 it is relatively easy to detect and exploit wireless access points.  Employees overseas should 

assume 
that 
their wireless communications (BlackBerry, cell phone, 
etc.
) are being monitored.
 Many software manufac
turers outsource software code development, which raises concerns 
about whether malicious or criminal code has been inserted.  Indeed, it is becoming increasingly 

difficult to determine the actual provenance of an organizations information systems because
 code and equipment are assembled from so many sources.
 1.8.4 Lost or Stolen Equipment
 Lost or stolen equipment also poses a threat.  Data on portable computing devices (laptops, smart 

phones, 
etc.
) or storage media (Universal Serial Bus (USB) drives, 
Compact D
isks (CD), 
etc.
) can reveal sensitive information, such as changes to legislation, investigations, or economic 

analyses.  Thefts from offices, airports, automobiles, and hotel rooms occur regularly.
 1.8.5 Supply Chain Threats
 A supply chain threat
 is a man
-made t
hreat achieved through exploitation of the systems supply 
chain or acquisition process.
 A systems 
supply chain
 is composed of the organizations, people, activities, information, 
resources, and facilities for designing, creating and moving a product or se
rvice from suppliers 
through to the integrated system (including its sub
-components), and into service by the original 
acquirer.

   2.1.5 Risk Executive
 A Risk Executive ensures that risks are managed consistently across the organization.  In 

keeping with its organizational structure, DHS has two levels of Risk Executi
ve: Departmental 
and Component.  
The risk executive provides a holistic view of risk beyond that associated with 
DHS 4300A SENSITIVE 
SYSTEMS 
HANDBOOK
  v12.0, November 15, 2015
 15 the operation and use of individual information systems.  Risk Executive observations and 
analyses are documented and become part of the securi
ty authorization decision.   
 All DHS Risk Executives:
  Ensure that management of security risks related to information systems is consistent 
throughout the organization; reflects organizational risk tolerance
; and
 is performed as part of 
an organization
-wide process that considers other organizational risks affecting mission and 
business success
.  Ensure that information security considerations for individual information systems, including 

the specific authorization decisions for those systems, are viewed fr
om an organization
-wide 
perspective with regard to the overall strategic goals and objectives of the organization
.  Provide visibility into the decisions of AOs and a holistic view of risk to the organization 

beyond the risk associated with the operation an
d use of individual information systems
, including those associated with the supply chain
.  Facilitate the sharing of security
-related and risk
-related information among 
Authorizing 
Officials (
AO) and other senior leaders in the organization in order to hel
p those officials 
consider all types of risks that could affect mission and business success and the overall 
interests of the organization at large
.  Ensure that System Owners, ISSOs and AOs monitor and manage supply chain risks, as part 
of the overall Comp
onent risk management strategy. 
 The DHS Risk Executive develops information security policy, establishes the standards for 
system security risk, oversees risk management and monitoring, and approves all waivers to 

DHS policy.
 Component Risk Executives may
 establish system security risk standards more stringent than 
DHS standards.  Risk Executives implement the system security risk management and 

monitoring program and submit requests for higher
-risk deviations from the enterprise standard.
 2.1.6 Authorizing Offi
cial
 (AO)
 The AO formally assumes responsibility for operating an information system at an acceptable 

level of risk.  He or she 
is to 
be a senior management official and a Federal employee or member 
of the U.S. military.  The AO assign
s the Security Contro
l Assessor for the system.
 2.1.7 Security Control Assessor
 The Security Control Assessor is a senior management official whose responsibilities include 

certifying the results of the security control assessment.  A Security Control Assessor is assigned 

in writing
 to each information system by 
the 
Component 
CISO.
  The Security Control Assessor 
and the team conducting a certification must be impartial. 
 They must be free from any perceived 

or actual conflicts of interest with respect to the developmental, operationa
l, and or management 
chains of command associated with the information system; or with respect to the determination 

of security control effectiveness.
 For systems with low impact, a Security Control Assessor and/or certifying team does not need 

to be indep
endent so long as assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by an 

independent team of experts to validate their completeness, consistency, and truthfulness.
 The AO decides
 the required level of 
assessor
 independence based on
:  DHS 4300A SENSITIVE 
SYSTEMS 
HANDBOOK
  v12.0, November 15, 2015
 16  The criticality 
and sensitivity of the information system 
  The ultimate risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, and individuals
  The level of assessor independence required for confidence that the assessment results are 
sound and valid for making credible
 risk
-based decisions.
 2.1.8 Information Systems Security Officer
 (ISSO)
 An ISSO performs security actions for an information system
.  There is only one ISSO 
designated to a system, but multiple Alternate ISSOs may be designated to assist the ISSO.
 Background in
vestigations in accordance with Section 4 of DHS Sensitive Systems Policy 

Directive 4300A are required for ISSOs.
 While the ISSO performs security functions, the System Owner is always responsible for 

information system security.
 See 
Attachment C to this H
andbook, Information Systems Security Officer (ISSO) Designation 
Letter.
 2.1.9 Ongoing Authorization 
(OA) 
Manager and Operational Risk Management Board
 (ORMB)
 Each Component 
has
 an OA Manager responsible for evaluating and tracking security events for 
systems 
operating under the DHS OA Program.  Component OA Managers:
  Account for Component risk threshold
  Ensure that Component Risk Executives [
see Sec. 
2.15] are made aware of new risks and 
security issues
  Facilitate collaboration of the Component IT Security SME
s that serve on the Operational 
Risk Management Board (ORMB)
 Component ORMBs determine the criticality of security triggers and the impact of triggers on 

the security posture of Component systems that are in OA. The ORMB determines the level of 

each trigge
rs visibility and recommends to the Component CISO and AO as adjudicators the 
actions required to mitigate the risks introduced.
 2.1.10 DHS Security Operations Center
 (SOC)
 The DHS Enterprise SOC 
(DHS SOC) 
is charged to act as a single point for DHS enterprise
-
wide cyber situational awareness.  As such, DHS Enterprise SOC provides incident management

 Management controls are security controls 
that focus on 
the 
management of risk and information 
system security
.  The controls 
include 
conducting risk assessments, developing 
Rules of 
Behavior
, and ensuring that security is an integral part of 
both 
the System

.  Management 
controls consist
 of techniques and concerns that are normally addressed by management 
personnel
. 3.1 Basic Requirements
 Basic security management principles must be followed in order to ensure the security of 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) information resources.  These
 principles are applicable 
throughout the Department and form the cornerstone of the DHS Information Security Program.
 Component Chief Information Security Officers (CISO) and Information Systems Security 

Managers (ISSM) submit all security reports concern
ing DHS systems to the Component senior 
official or designated representative.  Component CISOs/ISSMs interpret and manage DHS 

security policies and procedures to meet Federal, Departmental, and Component requirements.  

Component CISOs/ISSMs also answer da
ta queries from the DHS CISO and develop and 
manage information security guidance and procedures unique to Component requirements.
 Information Systems Security Officers (ISSO) are the primary points of contact for the 

information systems assigned to them. 
 They develop and maintain Security Plans (SP) and are 

responsible for overall system security.

identification of critical DHS assets.  Once critical systems are identified, continuity planning 

address
es the following two different but complementary elements:
  Continuity of Operations 
(COOP) 
Planning
  Contingency Planning
 (CP)
 The C
OOP planning element requires Components to develop, test, exercise, and maintain 
comprehensive plans so that essential business functions can be continued
.  The 
COOP 
Plan 
is 
business oriented and focus
es on sustaining an organizations essentia
l functions until the 
primary site can be restored.
 The Contingency Planning element is designed to sustain and recover critical 
information
 services
.  Contingency plans focus on sustaining the critical applications and general support 
systems needed to su
pport essential operations
.  The thrust of contingency planning is to assure 
the continuous availability of critical systems
; to 
protect assets and vital records
; to 
mitigate 
disruptions to operations
; to provide maximum safety to personnel
; and 
to 
achieve
 a timely and

 3.7 Confi
guration Management
 (CM)
 Configuration Management (CM) includes management of all hardware and software elements 
of 
information systems and networks.  CM within
 DHS consists of a multi
-layered structure 
 policy, 
procedures, processes, and compliance monitoring.  Each Component 
uses its own 
appropriate 

level of configuration management.
 CM applies to all systems, sub
systems, and components of the DHS
 infrastructure, and ensures 
implementation and continuing life
-cycle maintenance.  CM begins with baselining of 
requirements documentation and ends with decommissioning of items no longer used for 

production or support.
 The CM discipline applies to hardware, including power systems, software, firmware, 
documentation, test and support equipment, and spares.  A Change 
Management Process
 ensures 
that documentation associated with an approved change to a DHS system is updated 
to reflect the 
appropriate baseline, including an analysis of any potential security implications.  The initial 

configuration must be documented in detail and all subsequent changes must be controlled 

through a complete and robust CM process.  
 Users repor
t known or 
suspected implementations of unauthorized IT changes to DHS Enterprise 
Configuration Management (ICCB.Services@hq.dhs.gov). 
 For more information regarding how 
DHS 4300A SENSITIVE

 40 unauthorized changes are addressed, refer to the DHS ICCB Unauthorized Change Trackin
g Process. 
 Configuration management has security implications in three areas:
  Ensuring that the configuration of subordinate information system elements is consistent with 
the Security Authorization Process requirements of the parent system 
 Ensuring that any subsequent changes (including an analysis of any potential security 

implications) are approved 
 Ensuring that all recommended and approved security patches are properly installed
 As new systems
 and newly modified systems proceed through the SE
LC, changes must be 
documented and tested prior to placing the systems into 
an 
operational environment.  
The 
objective is to ensure that new vulnerabilities are not introdu
ced during the change process
.  The 
same requirements apply to operational systems as they undergo periodic modifications. 
In todays climate, new vulnerabilities quickly present themselves and often the risk of not 
implementing vendor-
supplied patches exceeds the risk of instal
ling an untested patch.  
Components must have provisions for reacting q
uickly as these critical patches are identified and 

released by the 
DHS 
Security
 Operations Center (S
OC).  Configuration management policies 
must include provisions for quickly testing and approving time-
sensitive changes that result from 
newly released vu
lnerability information.

appropriate development 
team (for new 
development systems) or the O&M Support Team (for fielded sys
tems) to ensure that all 
proposed changes to the configuration baseline are analyzed and tested to determine the
ir security implications
.  As new vulnerabilities are identified during the testing process, 
appropriate security software patches must be devel
oped and installed prior to implementation of 
the proposed change.  
Any changes that impact the security posture of the system must be 
brought to the attention of the Security Control Assessor and the 
AO. 
Proposed configuration changes to operating systems, operating system security features, 
applications, critical system files, and system devices must be approved 
through the CM process 

and documented prior to the change being implemented.  
If the change is deemed to be 
significant, the 
Security Authorizati
on Process documentation must be updated. 
The 
CM process continues throughout the

 and 
Security 
Control
 Assessments
 DHS periodically assesses the selection of security controls to determine their continued 
effectiveness in providing an appropriate level of protection.
 It is recommended that Components pursue
 Type 
Security Authorization 
for information 
resources that are under the same direct management control; have the same function or mission 
objective, operating characteristics, security needs, and that reside in the same general operating 

environment, or in 
the case of a distributed system, reside in various locations with similar 

operating environments.  
 Type 
Security Authorization
 consist
s of a master 
security 
authorization 
package describing the 
common controls implemented across sites and site
-specific c
ontrols and unique requirements 
that have been implemented at the individual sites.
 The DHS 
Security Authorization Process Guide
 describes detailed processes governing 
security 
authorization 
and system risk assessment.
 Detailed information for creating a
nd managing POA&Ms is published in 
this Handbooks 
Attachment H
, Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) Process Guide
. The Federal Information Security 
Modernization
 Act
 of 2014
 (FISMA
) directs that
 all Federal 
agencies develop and implement 
an agency
-wid
e information system security program designed 
to safeguard 
information systems
, assets
, and data
.  The Departments 
Security Authorization 
Process 
policy 
is based o
n the recommendations set forth in NIST SP 800
-37, and OMB Circular 
A-130. Security Control
 Assessment 
is the comprehensive testing and evaluation of the management, 
operational, and technical security features of an 
information 
system
.  It addresses software and 
hardware security safeguards; considers procedural, physical, and personnel securit
y measures; 
and establishes the extent to which a particular design and implementation meets a specified
 set 
of security requirements
.  It also considers procedural, physical, and personnel security measures 
employed to enforce information security policy.
 Authorization 
is the official management decision that 
permits 
the operation of a
 system
.  It 
includes explicitly accepting the risk to 
Department
 operations, assets, or individuals, based on 
the implementation of an agreed
-upon set of security controls
.  The 
AO accepts security 
responsibility for the operation of 
an assess
ed system and officially 
grants A
uthority

Operate 
(ATO)
.  AOs 
are
 to 
be identified in 
Information Assurance Compliance System (IACS)
.  The

 3.9.1 Ongoing Authorization 
(OA)
 The DHS OA Program builds upon an information systems existing Security Authorization; the 
purpose of 
the 
Ongoing Authorization (
OA) Program is continuous evaluation of security 
controls, based on system-
specific information, and timely actio
n in response to changes to 
information systems and risk posture.   
OA enhances the information assurance life cycle process by replacing the periodic three
-year 
assessment cycle with ongoing security assessments that are driven by risk as opposed to time. 
The 
DHS Ongoing Authorization Methodology 
describes detailed processes governing the OA 
Programs requirements and entrance criteria for a Component and for a Components systems.  
The 
OA Methodology defines the deliverables and templates required for mai
ntaining compliance with 
OA as well as required and recommended internal procedures. 
Components are accepted into the 
OA program by the DHS CISO according to the provisions of 
DHS Ongoing Authorization 
Methodology 
with the concurrence of the Component AO and/or CIO.   
Processes and procedures within the OA program are governed by DHS Sensitive Systems Policy 
Directive 4300A.  
  3.9.1.1 Key Ongoing Authorization Artifacts 
3.9.1.1.1 Control Allocation Table 
(CAT)
 The Control Allocation Table (CAT) is a risk
-based tailoring of controls that outlines frequency, 
rigor, and impact of each control.  It is updated over time to meet changing risks in response to 
triggers. Each systems security team determines how often each control was evaluated based on 

DHS 4300A guidance, NIST SP 800-
53 tailoring guidance, accounting for mission, criticality 
and other organizational factors.  
The authoritative and accepted Control Allocation Table will 

be created and managed in IACS.
 3.9.1.1.2 Trigger Accountability Log
 (TRAL)
 The Trigger Accountability Log (
TRAL) acts as a running list of all triggers for all systems in 
OA for each Component.  The TRAL allows Components to track and document the number and 

type of events occurring for a system, provides DHS with visibility into Component activities, 

and serve
s as an audit trail.
 DHS 4300A SENSITIVE 
SYSTEMS 
HANDBOOK
  v12.0, November 15, 2015
 48 The appropriate operational and security staff will constantly monitor for trigger events. Triggers 
can be either 
routine or non
-routine
. Routine triggers
 are events that are normal or scheduled 
occurrences. They are planned and are kn
own to the operations and security personnel. 
 Non
-Routine triggers
 are events that are out
-of-cycle, anomalies, of unknown origin or activity. 
 They 
are detected through Continuous Monitoring mechanisms (e.g. Intrusion Detection/Prevention 

Systems and Fir
ewalls). 
 These trigger types are explained 
as follows:
  Routine Triggers
  Minor system release
  Major system release
  Change in external connections
  Development/O&M contract turnover
  System Owner change
  ISSO change
  Technology change (e.g. 
database)
  Non
-routin
e Triggers
  Security incident
premeditated attack (external or internal)
  Security incident
suspicious or malicious user activity (external or internal)
  Zero day attack
  Malware introduction (external or internal, malicious or accidental)
  3.9.1.2 Component Admission
 Components must meet the eligibility requirements and be approved by the Department to 

implement Ongoing Authorization. 
 The criteria for Component eligibility are descri
bed in the 

subsequent sections.
 3.9.1.2.1 Robust Continuous Monitoring
 This requirement uses th
e DHS Scorecard, which is the barometer of Information Security 
Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) in DHS. The metric of the total ISCM score is the basis of this 
requirement. 
 This average score is derived from the following ISCM Metrics: 
  Hardware Asset Manage
ment 
  Software Asset Management 
  Configuration Management 
  Vulnerability Management 
  Anti
Virus 
  Information Security Vulnerability Management (ISVM)
 Maintaining an ISCM score of 80% or higher over three (3) consecutive months is indicative of a 
Component 
that has a fully functioning Continuous Monitoring initiative. Components interested 

in OA participation must meet that score.

 49 3.9.1.2.2 Approved Common Controls
 The CAT) is a core requirement for systems to be admitted to OA. Components must define 
Common Controls 
within the IACS tool, along with expressed approval from the AO in the form 

of a signed Risk Acceptance letter. 
 This ensures 
that 
CATs are filled out accurately
 and 
 show 
the inheritance of controls from the Component CISO Program level.
 3.9.1.2.3 Designated Ongoin
g Authorization Manager
 The Component Ongoing Authorization Manager (OAM) will serve as the primary non
-
executive director of their OA Program. 
 The OA Manager directs the Operational Risk 

Management Board (ORMB) and is the first line of defense for alerte
d triggers and 

communications from the Component CISO or the Department. 
 At least one OAM must be 

designated in writing before a Component can be entered into the DHS OA Program. 

Components may opt to assign additional deputy OAMs at their discretion.
  Once a package has 
completed the necessary OA entrance requirements that are defined in official DHS policy 

documents (e.g., DHS 4300, OA Methodology), submission is then possible into the DHS OA 

Program.
 3.9.1.2.4 Chartered Operational Risk Management Board
 A key fu
nction of OA is the ORMB, which decides how triggers are handled and how risk is 
accepted or remediated. Each Component must determine how to operate or construct its ORMB, 

but it also must ensure ORMBs function as specified in the Ongoing Authorization Me
thodology 
and other DHS policies. 
 While their membership and activities may have commonalities, the 
ORMB is different from the Change Management Board (CMB). 
 The 
events and activities 

pertinent to each board are shown in Table 1.

 50 3.9.1.2.5 System Admission Requirements
 Components that have been approved for OA by DHS can nominate Systems to undergo OA. 
However, nominated Systems are not automatically enrolled in OA. Systems have their own 

eligibility c
riteria. 
 The criteria for System eligibility are:
 3.9.1.2.5.1 Component Accepted into the Ongoing Authorization Program 
 Systems that desire to be included in the Ongoing Authorization Program must have the 

oversight and management of a participating Component in ord
er to process triggers, have a 

credible ORMB, and must enter all systems and all artifacts into IACS to ensure the system 

authorization of their individual programs. 
 3.9.1.2.5.2 Ongoing Authorization System Admission Letter
 The Ongoing Authorization System Admission 
Letter serves as the formal CISO 
recommendation via the Authorizing Official (AO) of a system regarding its eligibility to begin 
participation in the DHS Ongoing Authorization (OA) program
. This letter does not permit 
systems to be designated as an officia
l OA system until a full review is performed by the DHS 

OA Team for suitability and subsequent admission. 
 3.9.1.2.5.3 Ongoing Authorization Recommendation Letter
 The Ongoing Authorization Recommendation Letter serves as the formal CISO recommendation 
to the AO of a s
ystem regarding triggers that get escalated from the ORMB and system eligibility 
to continue participation in the OA program. 
 This recommendation shall be completed and 

approved by all relevant parties as requested. 
 DHS provides a template for the OA 

Rec
ommendation Letter, but Components may develop their own internal communications as it 
relates to their unique mission and operations. 
 3.9.1.2.5.4 ATO Expiration Greater than 60 Days of Submission Date
 Systems being considered for entrance into OA shall have an ATO w
ithin this time frame, unless 
by waiver of a Component CISO or AO. 
 The logic behind this is that a system with an expiring 

ATO under the old system may not be up to date with its control assessments and evaluation of 

its security posture.
  It is ultimatel
y up to the Components if they wish to accept this risk in 
writing and allow systems with ATOs of shorter expiration duration to enter OA. 
 Systems that 

have expired ATOs are not permitted. 
 3.9.1.2.5.5 ISSO with Collateral Responsibilities that are less than 51%
 Syst
ems are required to have ISSOs with less than 51% of collateral duties in order to function 
within the limits of OA.
  The intent of this requirement is to ensure that systems have dedicated 
security professionals that have adequate time to execute the duti
es required as part of Ongoing 
Authorization
.   3.9.1.2.5.6 ISSO Trained on Ongoing Authorization Processes
 ISSOs are required to have completed both Department and Component OA training to ensure 
that OA policies and procedures are carried out to maintain ongoing awa
reness of the security 
DHS 4300A SENSITIVE 
SYSTEMS 
HANDBOOK

 51 posture of DHS. 
 This is in parallel with the current philosophy and requirements that are placed 
on Privileged Users in the DHS enterprise. 
   3.9.1.2.5.7 Approved Control Allocation Table (CAT)
 Per DHS Ongoing Authorization (OA) entry criteria
, each system must have a unique Control 
Allocation Table (CAT) that traces NIST controls to their proper source(s). 
 The systems 
security team will determine how often each control is evaluated based on NIST SP 800
-53 tailoring guidance, mission, critica
lity and other organizational factors. 
 After declaring how the 
system is to be monitored on an ongoing basis, internal and enterprise processes are used to 

maintain the systems security posture. 
 Changes to the CAT may be necessary as events are 

triggere
d that affect the system. 
   To illustrate that all federal and organizational requirements are met, each of the systems 

controls are formally documented, numbered, and mapped to their source(s) in a CAT. 
 By 

identifying controls and design requirements a
lready tested (through inheritance, common 
controls, or through Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation), the CAT provides insight into 

those controls NOT adequately assessed by an automated tool or other method. This information 

is combined with the system
s mission and organizational objectives to determine the review 
frequency and impact for each control.
    3.9.1.3 Information Assurance Compliance Systems (IACS)
 Each system that participates in the DHS OA Program must utilize the IACS tool and ensure all 
informat
ion is accurate and up
-to-date. 
 During the migration from the Trusted Agent FISMA 
(TAF) system to IACS, all DHS systems in TAF and their stored artifacts were migrated to 
IACS. 
 Each system is required to complete the IACS workflow up to the OA tasks. Sys
tems 
cannot complete the OA portion of the IACS workflow until the previous tasks are completed. 
 The OA enrollment verification tasks in the IACS workflow are designed to prepare systems for 

entering and participating in the DHS OA Program. 
 They also pro
vide nonrepudiation for each 

level of the IACS approval process before the system is presented to the DHS OA Team for 

evaluation. 
 The steps include filling out a checklist for the basic OA requirements and the 

subsequent approvals for the requirements whi
ch are illustrated in the figure below. 
 These 
internal Component
based approvals of the requirements checklist, directly relate to the 
requirements for system entry into the OA Program, will help ensure a smooth evaluation 

process by the DHS OA Team. 
 Fig
ure 4: IACS Ongoing Authorization Process Flow 
 Final approval and consideration of a system for OA remains with the DHS OA Managers. 
 Once 
approved, a system must build the Control Allocation Table and complete the Ongoing 

Authorization System Admission L
etter.

-by-step procedures of how OA is implemented in 
IACS are available in the Appendix I: OA IACS Procedures.
  3.9.2 FIPS 
199 Categorization and the NIST SP 800
-53 Controls
 The 
high watermark requirement 
is the concept whereby the highest impact level of
 any of the 
security objectives (confidentiality, integrity, availability) must be used for a system as a whole.   
DHS 4300A SENSITIVE 
SYSTEMS 
HANDBOOK
  v12.0, November 15, 2015
 52 Within 
DHS, the high water mark requirement is amplified to reflect the actual security 
requireme
nts 
that 
controls 
must 
meet
.   Within DHS, 
those 
controls
 required 
to support the security objective
s for an 
information 
system 
are 
implemented
.  There is no 
requirement to implement extra controls
 beyond this 
minimum 
standard
, but 
any program 
may 
implement 
additional or 
more 
stringent 
control
s.  This policy 
amplification is a 
Department
-level risk
-based decision that is consistent with 
the 
FISMA 
requirement to 
cost
-effectively reduce information security risks to an acceptable level. 
 The 
tailoring of controls and use of compensating controls is a
lso consistent with providing the 
safeguards necessary to reduce the risks 
with
in a specific 
operat
ing
 environment.
 This policy amplification is also consistent with the NIST information security guidance which 

promulgates the concept of risk
-based decisi
ons. 
 The due diligence required by FIPS 199
, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems
, requires determination of 
the exact impact level 
of 
each type of information 
on the system, and 
on each of the security o
bjectives
; this due diligence
 will lead to well
-defined impact levels for 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability 
across
 system
s.  It is important, when using a risk
-based decision
, to minimize the security controls
 and to ensure 
that all of the infor
mation and the 
risks to that information 
are
 clearly defined and documented
, so that 
the 
AO can make an 
informed 
risk
-based 
decision for the system and its information in 
its specific operational 
environment.
 The 
DHS FIPS 199 Workbook
 defines
 impact 
leve
l categories
 (high, moderate, low)
.  Each 
security objective is assigned to one of these categories.
  Appropriate control implementation is 
given by the 
Workbook
 for each category; for example, 
a system with low risk availability, high 
risk integrity, and 
low risk confidentiality 
is 
not required to implement h
igh controls across the 
board
, but 
rather the controls that 
revealed by
 the analysis
.  In this example, categorization 
analysis would indicate 
high level integrity controls
 and 
low 
level controls 
confi
dentiali
ty and 
availability
. For systems involving 
Personally Identifiable Information (
PII
), the confidentiality security 
objective 
is assigned
 a minimum 
impa
ct level of moderate. If warranted by a 
risk
-based 
assessment
 the confidentiality security obje
ctive 
is elevated to 
high.
 All 
CFO Designated Systems
 are
 assigned a minimum impact level of moderate for 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability
.  If warranted by a risk based assessment, the integrity 
objective 
is elevated to high.
 This Handbo
oks Attachment M
, Tailoring the NIST SP 800
-53 Security Controls,

NIST 
SP 800-53 controls by impact level and by security objective, and provides information on 
the possible tailoring of these controls and the use of compensating controls.

 3.9.5 Risk Assessment
 Risk Assessment
 is the process of identifying risks to system s
ecurity
, determining the 
probability of occurrence
 and
 the resulting impact, and 
identifying 
additional safeguards th
at 
would mitigate 
that impact
.  An initial risk assessment is used to understand the unique system 
risks and to determine 
whether or not
 any controls are required to address specific threats or 
weaknesses
.  The initial assessment incorporates system characterization information, security 
categorization, 
PTA
 and PIA, and e
-Authenticati
on assessment
.  The results 
are
 used to directly 
address th
e controls that will be documented in the 
Security 
Plan
 and implemented in the system.
 An initial Risk Assessment 
is 
conducted
 within 
IACS
 whenever a 
Security Authorization Process
 package is initiated.
 The initial 
assessment
 is 
created
 after 
security
 cont
rols are implemented and tested
, and 
is 
updated and revised whenever 
corre
ctive actions 
or changes 
are 
applied
.  The 
amount of 
residual 
risk 
is identified throughout the process
. DHS follows the overall risk process as described in NIST Special Publication
 800-30, Guide for 
Conducting Risk Assessments
. The 
Security Authorization Process 
Guide
 published by the DHS Office of the Chief Information 
Security Officer 
provides detailed information on developing Risk Assessment
s. 3.9.6 Security Plan
 (SP)
 The 
SP provides
 a complete description of 
an information system, including purposes
, functions, 
system boundaries, architecture, user groups, interconnections, hardware, software, encryption 
techniques, transmissions, and network configu
ration
.  It also 
provides an overv
iew of the 
system
s security requirements
, describes the controls in place or planned
, and 
delineates the 
responsibilities and expected behavior of all individuals who access the system
.  The 
SP, typically written in conjunction with the Risk Assessment, i
s refined throughout the 

authorization 
process.
 3.9.7 Contingency Plan
 (CP)
 A CP documents the m
anagement polic
ies 
and procedures designed to maintain or restore 
business operations
 in the event of emergencies, system failures, or disaster
.  Specific control 
req
uirements and level of effort are determined based on the systems security categorization
.  DHS 4300A SENSITIVE 
SYSTEMS 
HANDBOOK
  v12.0, November 15, 2015
 54 The level of resources for the Contingency Plan is based on the 
security categorization for the 
availability security objective
:   For systems with a
 low impact for
 availability
, the 
System Owner
 may 
determine the 
CP format and content that is appropriate for t
he system and its environment
.  The 
CP created
 in 
IACS
 is used
 for tailoring 
such 
plans
.  For systems with a 
moderate impact level for availability
, the default
 CP in 
IACS
 is used.
  For s
ystems with a 
high impact level for availability
 a rigorous 
CP is developed
.  The 
DHS-developed high impact 
CP, IT Contingency and Disaster Recovery Plan
, is used
; it is 
found in 
IACS
; the 
template in 
this Handbook
s Attachment 
K, IT Contingency Plan 
Template
 is aligned with it.

 as part of the
 Security Authorization Process 
package
; it is populate
d with sample test procedures
.  The procedures will need to be tailored to the pa
rticular 
SP, risks, and system environment, and they will need to be supplemented with detailed technical 
methods and procedures.

 3.9.9 Contingency Plan Testing
 Contingency Plan testing is the process of simulating an 
information
 security event and the 
subsequent activities undertaken to restore and recover the system.
 Contingency Plan testing is required onl
y for systems with a moderate or high impact for the 
availability security objective; it is optional for systems with 
a low impact for availability
.  Testing requirements

   A rigorous tabletop exercise, with a planned follow
-on for a full
-scale test, may be conducted 
whenever circumstances preclude a full
-scale test.  
The tabletop exercise is described
 below in 
the 
following 
section on moderate impact systems.
 3.9.9.2 Systems with Moderate Impact 
for 
Availability
  Testing R
equired
 Moderate 
Impact
 Availability
 systems should have an alternate site identified as part of their 
CPs, and resources for establishing 
an alternate site should be identified and made available, a 
full
-scale test of the 
CP.   Annual 
CP testing is required and a full
-scale test is encouraged, but is 
not required
.  A tabletop 
exercise is acceptable under most 
circumstances for
 most moderate 
impact systems, as 
determined by the System Owner.  In a tabletop exercise, the triggering incident, detection, 
containment, and recovery are simulated and a walk though is conducted by using a prepared 

scenario to demonstrate how system recovery would be 
achieved.  Recovery steps are executed 

in accordance with and by the actual individuals listed in the 
CP.  This test includes coordination 
with and involvement of the alternate site personnel, 
demonstrating that
:  Results for each step are 
being 
simulated a
s rigorously as possible.
  There is r
eference only to 
only 
personnel and other resources that will be located away from 
the site where the incident occurs.
  The exercise requires each organizational unit to explain how they would carry out their 
responsibili
ties.
  There is a 
timeline
, with reasonable times for events
, used to illustrate that the system could 
be brought to an operational condition within the allotted system recovery time.

  A SAR is automatically created in IACS.
 3.9.11 Plan of Action and Milestones
 (POA&M)
 A POA&M is required as part of the authorization package
.  The POA&M documents any the 
weaknesses that will b
e mitigated and the corrective actions that must be taken.  The POA&M It 
details the resources required, milestones, and scheduled completion dates, and assigns actions to 

individuals.  Detailed guidance on the POA&M process is found in Attachment H to thi
s Handbook, 
Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) Process Guide.
  When reviewing the 
authorization 
package, the AO may stipulate that certain POA&M activities be completed within 

a specific timeframe, or that additional compensating controls be implement

 Decision
 Criteria
 Authorization to Operate (ATO)
 The AO accepts the residual risk to the Departments operations or assets 
after assessing the results of the se
curity 
assessment
.  A full 
ATO
 is issued 
and the 
system is a
uthoriz
ed without any significant restrictions or limitations 
on its operation.
 Interim Authorization to Operate 
(IATO) (for systems in 
development testing and 

prototype systems only)
 The AO may 
issue an IATO for systems in development testing 
or for 
prototype systems a
fter assessing the results of the security 
assessment
.  The 
IATO authorizes 
the system to 
operat
e for 
up to 
six (
6) months
.  During this 
period, the effectiveness of security contr
ols must be closely monitored
.  If the 
AO 
has not officially 
authorized 
the system by the end of the IATO, 
he or 
she 
may
 grant a second and final IATO f
or a period of up to 
six (
6) additional 
months
.  The information system must 
receive a 
full ATO 
prior to 
becom
ing
 operational.
 Denial of Authorization to 
Operate
 Whenever 
the 
AO 
finds that the residual risk to the 
Department
s operations or 
assets is unacceptable, the authorization to operate the sy
stem is denied
.  The 
system is not 
authorized 
and can
not be placed into operation
.  For a system 
currently in operation, all activity 
is halted.
 3.9.14 Annual 
Self
-Assessments
 Annual assessments are performed 
during 
the Continuous Monitoring Phase of the 
authoriz
ation
.  They 
provide ongoing oversight and monitoring of th
e systems 
security controls
 and serve 
to 
inform the authorizing official when
ever
 changes 
occur 
that may impa
ct the security of the 
system
.  During this phase, the 
systems 
status is monitored to ensure that residual risk is kept 
within 
the 
acceptable lev
el, and 
that 
any significant changes 
to the 
system configuration or 
operational
 or 
threat environment are identified
.  Components must re
-authorize 
their systems

 and 
Data 
Securi
ty The DHS Privacy Office is responsible for privacy compliance across the Department, including 
assuring that technologies used by the Department sustain and do not erode privacy protections 

relating to the use of personal and Departmental information.  
The DHS Chief Privacy Officer 
has exclusive jurisdiction over the development of policy relating to PII
 and to privacy
-sensitive 
programs, systems, or initiatives
.  Questions concerning privacy
-related policy should be 
directed to the Component Privacy Offi
ce or Privacy Point of Contact (PPOC).  If the 
Component does not have a Privacy Office or PPOC, then please contact the DHS Privacy Office 

(privacy@hq.dhs.gov
 or 202
-343-1717) or refer to the DHS Chief Privacy Off
icer Web page 
at www.dhs.gov/privacy
 for additional information.
 The privacy controls in 
NIST SP 800
-53 Rev 4
, Appendix J
, are primarily for use by an 
organizations Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief
 Privacy Officer when working 
with program managers, mission/business owners, information owners/stewards, Chief 

Information Officers, Chief Information Security Officers, information system 

developers/integrators, and risk executives to incorporate effect
ive privacy protections and 
practices (i.e., privacy controls) within organizational programs and information systems and the 

environments in which they operate. 
 The privacy controls facilitate 
DHS efforts to comply with 
privacy requirements affecting tho
se 
Department
-wide and Component 
programs and
 systems 
that collect, use, maintain, share, or dispose of 
PII
 or other activities that raise privacy risks. 
 While the security controls in Appendix F are allocated to the low, moderate, and high baselines 

in A
ppendix D, the privacy controls 
in Appendix J 
are selected and 
implemented based on DHS
 privacy requirements and the need to protect the PII of individuals collected and maintained by 

DHS 
information systems and programs, in accordance with federal privac
y legislation, policies, 
directives, regulations, guidelines, and best practices.
 3.14.1 Personally Identifiable Information
 (PII)
 Various regulations place restrictions on the Governments collection, use, maintenance, and 

release of information about individual
s.  Regulations require agencies to protect PII, which is 
any information that permits the identity of an in
dividual to be directly or indirectly inferred, 
including 
other 
information 
that
 is linked or linkable to that individual regardless of whether the 
individual is a U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident, visitor to the U.S., or Department 

employee or contractor.
 Sensitive PII 
(SPII) 
is PII which if lost, compromised, or disclosed without authorization, could 

result in substantial harm, embarrassment,
 inconvenience, or unfairness to an individual.  
Examples of Sensitive PII include Social Security numbers, Alien Registration Numbers (A
-number), medical information, and criminal history.  The sensitivity of this data requires 
that 

stricter handling guid
elines be applied.  For more information on handling Sensitive PII see: 
Handbook for Safeguarding Sensitive Pe
rsonally Identifiable Information at the Department of 
Homeland Security.
 Consistent with 
Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPS)
, PII collected and maintained by 
DHS should be accurate, relev
ant, timely, and complete for the purpose for which it is to be 
used, as specified in public notices. In addition, DHS adheres to data minimization and retention 

requirements to collect, use, and retain only PII that is relevant and necessary for the purpo
se for 
DHS 4300A SENSITIVE 
SYSTEMS 
HANDBOOK
  v12.0, November 15, 2015
 63 which it was originally collected. 
 Programs will retain PII for only as long as necessary to fulfill 
the purpose(
s) specified in public notices and in accordance with a 
record retention schedule 
approved by National Archives and Records Administrat
ion (NARA).
   Additional PII and Sensitive PII
-related 
guidance is
 included in the following sections of th
is Handbook
:  Section 3.9, Security Authorization Process, and Security Control Assessments 
 (For 
Privacy Sensitive Systems, the confidentiality secu
rity objective 
is assigned an impact level 
of at least moderate.
  Section 4.8.2, Laptop Computers and Other Mobile Computing Devices 
 All information 
stored on any laptop computer or other mobile computing device is to be encrypted using 

mechanisms that co
mply with Section 5.5, Encryption, of 
DHS Sensitive Systems Policy 
Directive 4300A.  
  Section 5.2.2, Automatic Session Termination 
 Sessions on workstations and on laptop 
computers and other mobile computing devices are to be terminated after twenty (20) 
minutes of inactivity.
  Section 5.3, Auditing 
 DHS defines computer
-readable data extracts as any Federal record 
or collection of records containing sensitive PII that is retrieved from a DHS
-owned 
database, through a query, reporting tool, extract genera
tion tool, or other means that is then 
saved into removable media and/or a separate computer
-readable device or application such 
as another database, a spreadsheet, or a text file." (
see 
Attachment S1
)  Section 5.4.1, Remote Access and Dial
-in 
 Remote acce
ss of PII must be approved by the 
AO.  Strong authentication via 
Virtual 
Private 
Network (VPN) or equivalent encryption (e.g., 
https) and two
-factor authentication is required.  DHS has an immediate goal that remote 
access should only be allowed with two
-factor authentication where one of the factors is 
provided by a device separate from the computer gaining access.  Restrictions are placed on 

the downloading and remote storage of PII accessed remotely, as noted below in this 

document.
  Attachment S, Compli
ance Framework for Privacy Systems.
 The DHS Privacy Office works with Component Privacy Officers, PPOCs, Program Managers, 

System Owners, and information systems security personnel to ensure that sound privacy 

practices and controls are integrated into the
 Departments operations.  The DHS Privacy Office 
implements three types of documents for managing privacy practices and controls for 

information systems:
  A PTA provides a high level description of an information system including the information 
it contain
s and how it is used.  The PTA is used to determine and document whether or not a 
PIA and/or SORN are required.  
  A PIA is a publicly released assessment of the privacy impact of an information system and 

includes an analysis of the PII that is collected, 
stored, and shared.  
  A System of Records Notice (SORN) describes the categories of records within a system of 

records and describes the routine uses of the data and how individuals can gain access to 
records and correct errors.

 3.14.3 Privacy
 Impact Assessments
 (PIA)
 A PIA is a publicly released assessment of the privacy impact of an information system and 

includes an analysis of the PII that is collected, stored, and shared.  PIAs are required (as 

det
ermined by the PTA) whenever a new information system is being developed or an existing 
system is significantly modified.  PIAs are the responsibility of the System Owner and the 

Program Manager as part of the SELC process.  OMB Memorandum M
-03-22, DHS MD 
047-01, and the 
Official
 DHS Privacy Impact Assessment Guidance
 discuss the requirements for 
conducting PIAs at DHS.
 PIAs are one tool that DHS uses to convey public notice of information practices and the privacy 

impact of Department programs and activitie
s.  The Department also uses web privacy policies, 
System of Records Notices, and Privacy Act Statements to provide effective public notice of 

program privacy practices.  PIAs also document how DHS makes individuals active participants 

in the decision

 3.14.4 System
 of Record Notice
 (SORN)
 The 
Privacy Act of 1974 requires a SORN when PII is maintained by a Federal agency in a 
system
 of records and the PII is retrieved by a personal identifier.  
A system of records is 
a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information 
is retrieved by the 

name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular 
assigned to the individual
1.  The SORN describes the categories of records and individuals in 
the system of record; the routine uses of the d
ata; how individuals can gain access to records 
pertaining to them and correct errors.  
The term system of records is not synonymous with 
information system and can include paper as well as electronic records.  SORNs can be written 

to cover the records
 in a single group of records or a sin
gle information system or they can be 
written to cover multiple groups of records or multiple information systems.
 Information systems that are considered a system of record may not be designated operational 

until a SO
RN has been published in the 
Federal Register
 for 
30 days.  
OMB has issued the 
benchmark references for development of SORNs:

the system of records.  This process is called the Bi
ennial SORN Review Process.  The DHS 
Privacy Office works with Compone

years following publication in the Federal Register.
 3.14.5 Protecting Privacy Sensitive Systems
 OMB M
-06-16, Protection of Sensitive Age

 Government services are secure and that individual privacy is protected.  E
ach DHS system must 
be evaluated to determine whether e
-authentication requirements apply.  Only federated identity 
providers approved through the Federal CIO Councils Identity, C

either as specified in public notices, in a manner compatible with those 
specified purposes, or as otherwise permitted by law.  Any PII shared outside the Department 

must 
be for a purpose compatible with the purpose for which th
e PII was collected. 
 DHS uses PII only for legally authorized purposes and in a manner compatible with uses 
identified in the Privacy Act or in other public notices. The DHS Chief Privacy Officer and, 

where appropriate, legal counsel review and approve an
y proposed external sharing of PII, 
including with other public, international, or private sector entities, for consistency with uses 

described in the existing privacy compliance documentation such as PIAs and SORNs or other 

public notice(s).
  When a propo
sed new instance of external sharing of PII is not currently 

authorized by the Privacy Act or specified in a notice, 
the 
Chief Privacy Officer
 evaluates
 whether the proposed external sharing is compatible with the purpose(s) specified in the notice. 

If the
 proposed sharing is compatible, 
program owners
 review, update, and republish their PIAs,

3.16 Social Media
 Social Media hosts are public content sharing websites that allow indivi
dual users to upload, 
view, and share content such as video clips, press releases, opinions, and other information.  The 

DHS Office of Public Affairs (OPA) 
has 
publish
ed Terms of Service (TOS) and guidelines for 
posting to these sites.  In some cases the Department will develop its own TOS, and in other 

cases it will endorse those of other Federal agencies such as the General Services Administration 

(GSA) or Office of Personnel Management (OPM).  Due to the high threat of malware, Social 

Media host sites have been blocked at the Trusted Internet Connection (TIC). 
There are a number of security technologies that are especially important to consider when 
dealing with social media issues.  
Guidance on the following topics will be found in the indicated 

sections
 of this Handbook; the policy to be implemented is found in like-numbered sections of

 3.17 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
 (HIPAA)
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)
2 addresses the 
privacy of individuals health information by establishing a Federal privacy st
andard for health 
information and how it can be used and disclosed.
 HIPAA prohibits the use or disclosure without the authorization of the individual or as part of an 
exception contained in HIPAA of Protected Health Information (PHI), electronic or otherwi
se, 
for any purpose other than treatment, payment, or health care operations for that individual.
 Because of the diverse mission of DHS, it may be necessary for some Components to collect PHI 
as part of a larger mission requirement (for example detainee pr
ocessing, disaster relief, etc.).  
This section applies to all Components and personnel who collect, process, or store PHI (refer to 
NIST SP 800
-66 for further information).
 3.18 Cloud Services
 Cloud computing technologies allow DHS to address demand for better
, faster information 
services and to save resources, consolidate systems, and improve security. The essential 
characteristics of cloud computing 
 on-demand provisioning, resource pooling, elasticity, 
network access, and measured services 
 provide the pot
ential for DHS to reduce procurement 
and operating costs and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of services. 
 The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is a government
-wide 
program which provides a standardized approach to secu
rity assessment, authorization, and 
continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. 
 This approach uses a do once, use 

many times framework that will save cost, time, and staff required to conduct redundant agency 

security assessments. A memorandu
m establishing FedRAMP, 
Security Authorization of 
Information Systems in Cloud Computing Environments
, was
 issued by the Federal Chief 
Information Officer 
to all agency CIOs on December 8, 2011
.  The goal of FedRAMP 
is to 
provide a cost
-effective, risk
-based approach for the adoption and use of cloud services.  
 The purpose of FedRAMP is to: 
  Improve the consistency and quality of information security in the
 cloud
  Ensure trustworthy and re
-usable documentation and assessment of security controls
  Provide ongoing assurance and risk assessment of select cloud services
  Enable rapid and cost
-effective procurement of information systems/services for Federal

 DHS provides leadership to FedRAMP in Cyber security and operations, monitoring and 
reporting on security incidents a
nd providing data feeds for continuous monitoring.  
 In addition to JAB Membership, DHS provides a team of JAB Technical Representatives who 
provide subject matter expertise to the DHS JAB member and recommend authorization 
decisions as appropriate. 
 DHS a
lso holds the FedRAMP role for leading Cyber Security 
Operations and Incident Response. 
 This includes defining adequate, risk
-based, cost
-effective 
cyber security; the coordination of cyber security and operations; the development of continuous 
monitoring
 standards for on
-going cyber security of Federal Information Systems; and develops 
guidance on agency implementation of the TIC program with cloud services.
 Only when applying to FedRAMP for JAB review, CSP
s must use a FedRAMP accredited 
3PAO to independe
ntly validate and verify the security of the cloud service. To become a 
FedRAMP accredited 3PAO, candidate organizations undergo a rigorous evaluation of their 
information assurance competencies, experience with FISMA, and experience with testing 

security 
controls. 3PAO applicants must also demonstrate technical competence in the security 

assessment of cloud
-based information systems and meet the requirements of ISO/IEC 
17020:1998 for independent organizations performing inspections. If a 3PAO does not meet
 FedRAMP requirements or submits sub
-standard work products, they can lose their 
accreditation.

 74 4.0 OPERATIONAL CONTROLS
 4.1 Personnel
 Department of Homeland 
Security (DHS) systems face threats from a myriad of sources.  The 
intentional and unintentional actions of system users can potentially harm or disrupt DHS 

systems and facilities and could result in destruction or modification of the data being processed,
 
denial of service, and unauthorized disclosure 
of data.  It is thus highly important that stringent 

safeguards be in place to reduce the risk associated with these types of threats.
 4.1.1 Personnel Screening
 and Position Categorization
 Personnel accessing DHS s
ystems 
are required to
 have an appropriate security clearance
; a favorably adjudicated background investigation
 commensurate with the defined sensitivity level 

of the positions they hold
; and a valid need to know
.  The appropriate position sensitivity leve
l is 
based on such factors as the type and degree of harm the individual can cause through misuse of 

the system
 (e.g., disclosure of sensitive information, interruption of critical processing, computer 
fraud).
 Another prudent safeguard is to ensure that in
dividuals who support DHS systems are highly 

qualified technically and are adequately trained for the position they occupy
.  This reduce
s the 
risk of unintentional actions
.  While unintentional acts and accidents cannot be eliminated, 
effective training ca
n help to mitigate the possibility or frequency of 
such
 errors.
 Sensitivity levels for all 
Government
 positions involving the use, development, operation, or 
maintenance of 
information 
systems 
are required to
 be designated, and risk levels for each 
contrac
tor position 
are required to
 be determined.

 4.1.3 Access to Sensitive Information
 To protect sensitive information and limit
 the damage that can result from accident, error, or 
unauthorized use, the principle of least privilege must be applied.
 DHS 4300A SENSITIVE 
SYSTEMS 
HANDBOOK
  v12.0, November 15, 2015
 78 The principle of least privilege requires that users be granted the most restrictive set of privileges 
(or lowest clearance) needed for
 performance of authorized tasks
.  Users should be able to access 
only the system resources needed to fulfill their job responsibilities
.  Application of this principle 
ensures that access to sensitive information is granted only to those users with a vali
d need to 
know.

 4.1.4 Segregation
 of Duties
 and Least Privilege
 Segregation
 of duties is intended to prevent a single individual from being
 able to disrupt or 
corrupt a critical security process.
 Segregation
 of duties 
is necessary for adequate internal control of sensitive systems, because it 
ensures that no single individual has total control of a systems security mechanisms, and 
prevents a
 single individual 
from 
acting alone 
to 
subverta critical process or otherwise 
compromise 
the system
.   Assignment and segregation of system responsibilities must be clearly defined and documented 

for all DHS systems
.  Segregation of responsibilities, in a
ddition to appropriate access controls, 
is intended to ensure that no individual has all necessary authority or information access 
needed 

to engage in fraudulent activity without collusion
.  It is essential that thorough and specific job 
descriptions be do
cumented for every individual working with DHS systems and sensitive 

information.
 An example of 
segregation
 of duties is the 
segregation
 of security duties on a network system
.  One individual would be responsible for backing up the system
; another respons
ible for the 
physical access controls
; and another responsible for the access privileges.
 Whenever practical, the positions of security administrator and system administrator should be 
assigned to 
different 
individuals
.  The same principle should be applie
d to ISSO and system 
administrator positions
.  When 
it is not possible to have 
separate system and security 
administrators, the system administrator 
is responsible for maintaining the system security 
configuration, 
and
 is subject to periodic audit/configur
ation review by the ISSO.
 If a Component does not have sufficient manpower resources necessary to meet strict 

segregation
 of duties requirements, the appropriate 
Authorizing Official (
AO) may authorize 
exceptions, provided that a shortage of personnel is f
ormally identified as a residual risk and 
compensating controls have been 
established

 4.2 Physical Security
 Information systems must be physically and environmentally protected to prevent unauthorized 
disclosure, denial of service, destruction, or modification.  
Physical security represents the first 

line of defense against intruders attempting to gain 
physical access to 
systems and must be 

addressed during each step
 of the risk management cycle.  Cost-
effective controls are 
documented in the S
ecurity 
Plan and are evaluated during the 
Security Control Assessment.  
Residual risks a
re 
documented in the Security Authorization Process 
package an
d reviewed 
annually. 
4.2.1 General Physical Access
 General physical access controls restrict the entry and exit of personnel from an area, such as an 
office building, data center, or room 
whe
re sensit
ive information is accessed, stored or 
processed
.  Such 
controls protect against threats associated 
with the physical environment.  
Components should 
review the effectiveness of general physical access controls during business 

hours and at other times
.  Control effectiveness depends on the characteristics of the controls, 
their implementation
, and 
their 
operation. 
General physical access responsibilities are provided in the following table.

Physical controls include barriers, badges, guard or security forces, supporting infrastructure, 
contingency and emergency support, lighting, facility intrusion detection systems, and 

surveillance systems
.  Standards for physical security must be based on an analysis of mission 
criticality, severity of impact levels, local criminal and intelligence threats, and the valu
e of the 
equipment 
and data 
contained within the facility being protected. 
Security personnel must ensure that physical security controls are considered throughout 
a 
systems 
life 
cycle and 
reviewed in conjunction with the annual self-
assessments
.  The following 
controls should be considered and included in the appropriate 
Security Plan

. Persons not displaying proper creden
tials should be challenged
.  If there is any doubt as to their 
authorization, they 
should be
 escorted from the area and local security personnel 
should 
be 
notified
. Security personnel and supervisors at all management levels must ensure that all staff
, con

.  The fo
llowing should 
be 
consider
ed 
when developing 
a fire protection strategy:
  When a centralized fire suppression system is not available, fire extinguishers should be 
readily available:
  Facilities should 
make available/provide 
Class C fire extinguishers (which
 are designed 
for use with electrical fire and other types of fire).
  Fire extinguishers should be located in such a way that a user would not need to travel 

more than 50 feet to retrieve 
one.  Fire drills must be conducted 
annually 
to ensure that all person
nel are familiar with their 
responsibilities.
 4.2.1.7 Electronic Power Supply Protection
 Electrical power must be filtered through a
 UPS
 system for all servers and critical workstations
 and s
urge suppressing power strip
s used to protect all other 
computer
 equipmen
t from power 
surges.
 4.2.1.8 Temperature and Humidity Control
 When developing a strategy for temperature and humidity control, it is recommended that the 

environment be kept within the following limits, which are suitable for all classes of IT 

equipment:
  Temperatu
re:  Dry bulb temperature range: 64.4 F to 80.6 F  
  Humidity:  Dew Point 41.9 F to 60% RH and dew point 59 F 
 While many systems will continue to function when temperatures and humidity are beyond this 

range, the associated risk to data is increased. I
f operating ranges are established beyond these 
boundaries, Components should ensure that the range in no case exceeds that specified by the 

manufacturer of the most sensitive piece of equipment.  
 Humidity levels below those recommended may result in stat
ic; high temperatures may damage 
sensitive system elements.
  DHS 4300A SENSITIVE 
SYSTEMS

notification (via telephone, pager, or email) when the operating environment exceeds established 

boundaries.
 4.2.1.9 Housekeeping Considerations
 Housekeeping is anot
her important area to monitor.
  Subfloors (where installed) should be cleaned annual
ly.  If the computer room has carpet it should 
be of the antistatic variety
.  This also applies to
 areas that house wor
kstations
.  Dusting of hardware and vacuuming of work areas should be performed weekly with trash 
removal performed 
daily
.  Dust accumulation inside of monitors and computers is a hazard 
that
 can damage computer hardware.
  Cleaning supplies should not be sto
red inside the computer room.
 4.2.1.10 Personnel Safety Features

 rev 1
, Guidelines for Media Sanitization
, provides guidelines for the 
sanitization of numerous types of information storage media, including: 
 Magnetic disks (flopp
y disk
s; hard drives; USB removable media and drives, flash drives, 
and memory sticks with hard drives; 
etc.
) 
 Magnetic tapes (reel and cassette format magnetic tapes)
  Magnetic cards
  Optical disks (CDs, DVDs)
  Memory
  Hard copy (paper and microforms) 
 Networking devices such as routers 
 Handheld devices such as cell phones and personal digital assistants (PDA) 
 Equipment (copy machines, fax machines)
 This Handbook provides information on the sanitization requirements for media containing 
classified information.
 NIST SP 800
-88 identifies sanitization options for various storage media.  Sanitization options 
depend on the type of storage medium (e.g., hard drive, CD or DVD, hard copy), intended 

disposition of the medium (e.g., reuse, disposal), and FIPS 199 categorization for the 

confidentiality security objective (see Section 3.9.1, FIPS 199). 
NIST SP 800
-88 defines sanitization as the removal of data from storage media such that there is 
reasonable assurance the data cannot be easily retrieved and reconstructed
.  Sanitization methods 
include clearing, purging, and destruction: 
 Clearing
 is r
emoval
 of information stored on media in such a way that the information is 
irretrievable through means such as robust keyboard attacks or the use of data, disk, or file 
recovery techniques
.  For magnetic media such as hard drives and diskettes, simple deletion 
of files is not sufficient for clearing, as the deleted data can be retrieved by various recovery 

utilities
.  Overwriting the i
nformation with random data, however, will clear the media of 
information and will help ensure that the information is irretrievable except perhaps by 
DHS 4300A SENSITIVE 
SYSTEMS 
HANDBOOK
  v12.0, November 15, 2015
 93 advanced laboratory techniques
.  Overwriting cannot be used for magnetic media that are 
damaged or not wr
iteable
.  In such cases, the media must be physically destroyed.
  Purging
 is r
emoval of information stored on media in such a way that the information is 
irretrievable through any means, including advanced laboratory techniques
.  Executing the 
firmware Secu
re Erase command and degaussing are examples of acceptable methods for 
purging
.  Degaussers expose the medium to a strong magnetic field, which effectively erases 
the information (a degausser designed and approved for the type of medium being purged is 
req
uired)
.  Be aware that d
egaussing
 also 
destroys hard drives, as the firmware that manages 
the drive is also purged during the degaussing process
.  Degaussing is effective only on 
magnetic media such as hard drives, diskettes, and magnetic tapes
.  It is not
 effective on 
optical media such as CDs and DVDs
.  Destruction
 of media is the ultimate form of sanitization
.  Physical destruction can be 
accomplished through disintegration, incineration, pulverizing, shredding, and melting
.  Destruction of media should b
e conducted only by trained and authorized personnel
.  Safety, 
hazmat, and special disposition needs should be identified and addressed prior to conducting 

any media destruction.
 Sanitization also requires the removal of all labels, markings, and activity 
logs.
 Steps for 
sanitizing 
of media are 
as follows:
  Determine the categorization (i.e., low, moderate, or high impact) for the confidentiality 
security objective
  Determine whether the media will be disposed of or reused (either within or outside of the 
org
anization)
  Use 
Figure 
3 to determine the appropriate method of sanitization
  Refer to 
NIST SP 800
-88, 
Appendix A and Table A
-1, for sanitization options for the type of 
medium to be sanitized
  Validate and document the sanitization of the medium
. NIST SP 800
-88, Appendix F
, provides a sample sanitization validation form
  Sensitive media can be shipped to facilities for clearing, sanitization, or disposal (The 
National Security Agency (NSA) may accept sensitive media for destruction

 4.3.4 Production, Input/Output Controls
 Sensitive information should be 
sent 
through means that limit the potential for unauthorized 
disclosure
 regardless of 
the 
method
 of transmission
.  Since information t
ransmitted over 
unencrypted electronic links such as telephone lines may be intercepted, custodians of sensitive 
information should decide whether specific information warrants a higher level of protection
, such as that 
afforded by a secure fax, secure pho
ne, or other encrypted means.
 Sensitive information may be sent via the U.S
.  Postal Service, Army Post Office (APO), 
commercial messenger, or 
unclassified
 registered pouch, provided it is packaged in a way that 
does not disclose its contents (
e.g., 
double
-enveloped).
 In data
 center environments, procedures should be implemented to account for the receipt of 
input and output media (paper, magnetic, optical, etc.)
.  Rosters of 
persons authorized to submit 
or receive 
input or output should be maintained
.  Log

 4.4 Voice Communications Security
 This sectio
n addresses vulnerabilities inherent in voice communications and the operational 
controls needed to mitigate the 
associated 
risks
.  Voice communication security 
includes 
Private 
Branch Exchange (PBX) systems, telephone usage, and voice mail
.  If 
Components
 choose to 
encrypt their voice communications, 
Advanced Encryption Standard (
AES
) encryption per FIPS 
140-2 must be used.
 4.4.1 Private Branch Exchange
 A PBX is a computer
-based switch that acts as a small, in
-house 
telephone exchange
 for the 
organization that o
perates it
.  Failure to secure a PBX system can result in toll fraud as well as 
theft of proprietary, personal, and confidential information
.  Moreover, an attacker could use the 
call tracking features of an unsecured PBX for traffic analysis to determine 
possible patterns of 
response to a planned 
intrusion
.  PBX p
rotecti
on is a high priority.
 Potential threats to a PBX include:
  Unauthorized access
  Traffic analysis
  Theft of service
  Disclosure of information
  Data modification 
  Denial of service
 PBXs are soph
isticated computer systems that 
are vulnerable to many of the same threats 
associated with general purpose operating systems
.  There are two important ways in which PBX 
security differs from conventional operating system security:
  External access/control
  PBXs typically require remote maintenance by vendor
s.  Local 
administrators 
often 
have 
the manufacturer remotely 
install
 updates, which 
requires remote 
maintenance ports and access to the switch by a potentially large pool of outside parties.

HANDBOOK
  v12.0, November 15, 2015
 96  Feature rich
ness
  The wide variety of features available on PBXs, particularly 
administrative features and conference functions, allow for the possibility of unexpected 
attacks
.  An attacker 
may 
eavesdrop by 
using 
feature
s in a manner not intended by its 
designers
.  Features may also interact in unpredictable ways, leading to system compromise 
even if each 
element
 of the system conforms to its security requirements and the system 
operation and administration are correct.

 98 4.4.1.1 Maintenance Vulnerabilities
 PBX manufacturers may include features useful 
on occasions 
when on
-site maintenance 
personnel cannot resolve problems
.  For example, t
he manufacturer could instruct maintenance 
personnel to
 configure and connect a modem to the maintenance port
, allowing remote access to 
certain special features 
in order 
to resolve problems without sending a representative to the 
PBX 
site
.  Use of such remote connections must be controlled 
and 
they must 
only 
be 
made available 
as needed in response to a particular problem
.  Use must also be 
logged, and supervised
.  These 
types of features must not be accessible via accounts held privately by the manufacturer
.  Proper 
password procedures must be enforced
. It is 
only by exception that passwords may expire in a 

shorter period 
(e.g., 
thirty 
days) or be single use (e.g., a secure remote access device)
.  All such 
access and changes to the PBX data and configuration must be logged.
 Examples of these special features in
clude:
  Database upload/download utility
  Allows the manufacturer to download the database 
from a system that is malfunctioning and examine it at their location to try to determine the 

cause of the malfunction
  Database examine/modify utility
  Allows the m
anufacturer to remotely examine and 
modify a systems database to repair damage caused by incorrect configurat
ion, design bugs, 
or tampering
  Software debugger/update utility
  Permits the manufacturer to remotely debug a 
malfuncti
oning system
.  It also all
ows the manufacturer to remotely update systems with b
ug 
fixes and software upgrades.
 These features are subject to intrusion, and could provide dangerous access to the PBX if 

misused
.  To mitigate the associated 
risks, ISSOs and site managers must:
  Ensure
 that remote maintenance access is not operational
.  Whenever possible, some 
involvement of local personnel in opening remote
 maintenance ports is required.
  Install two
-factor (i.e., two different mechanisms) strong authenticati
on on remote 
maintenance por
ts.  Smart Card
 based systems or one
-time password tokens, 
used 
in addition 
to conventional login/password functions, make it much more difficult for attackers to breach 

the systems security.
  Keep maintenance terminal
s in a locked restricted area
  Locate t
he PBX equipment in a locked restricted location
 that
 does not indicate what it 
contains (e.g., do not
 post a sign saying PBX room)
  Turn off maintenance features when not needed
  Verify that non
-U.S
.  Citizens do not perform maintenance
 4.4.1.2 Software Loading a
nd Update Tampering
 A PBX is particularly vulnerable to software tampering when 
software is initially loaded and 

when
ever
 software updates/patches are
 being
 applied
.  The PBX is particularly vulnerable to 
software tampering
.  An adversary could intercept a
 software update sent to a PBX administrator
.  To mitigate the risks associated with these vulnerabilities, ISSOs and site managers must:
 DHS 4300A SENSITIVE 
SYSTEMS 
HANDBOOK
  v12.0, November 15, 2015
 99  Make passwords resistant to cra
cking by automated tools
  Understand that conventional error detection codes such as che
cksums or 
Cyclic 
Redundancy 
Checks 
(CRC) are not suffici
ent to ensure tamper detection
.  Strong error detection based on 
cryptogra
phy provides better protection.
  Ensure that PBX boot disks, utilities, logs and records receive more protection than tha
t for 
typical office software
.  Strong physical security should be provided, and these items must be 
appropriately labeled (see Sections 4.3
.2 and 4.1
1 this 
Handbook
).  Shred printouts and s
anitize media before discarding
 4.4.1.3 User Features
 The many features that make
 PBXs easy to configure and use have led to an expansion of 
vulnerabilities
.  These features include:
  Attendant console/override/forwarding/conferencing
  Automatic call distribution (ACD)
  Override (intrude)
  Diagnostics
  Feature interaction
 To mitigate the ri
sks associated with these vulnerabilities, ISSOs and site managers must:
  Connect the 
attendant 
console to the PBX with a different physical connection than that of 
the telephone in
struments
  Use a line configuration feature if the 
attendant console connects
 to the PBX in the same 
manner
 as the telephone instruments
.  Such a feature could require specific line configuration 
for use with an 
attendant 
console
.  This would prevent the replacement of a telephone 
instrument with an 
attendant 
console to gain access
 to administrative features.
  Ensure that only e
ssential features are activated
  Log any changes to the configuration (software, data
base or physical) of the device
  Activate and periodically check any logging fa
cilities provided by the device
  Perform periodi
c reviews of security facilities, confirming proper configuration and proper 
correlation of manual logs
, device logs and other records
 4.4.2 Telephone Communications
 Unsecured telephones 
are
 not 
to 
be used to discuss classified security information
.  Moreover, 
care must be exercised in discussing sensitive information
.  Adequate protection of sensitive 
information requires 
awareness 
of the various risks related to telephone equipment and 
conversations
.  Components 
are required to
 ensure that users are cognizant o
f social engineering 
techniques used to obtain information over the telephone, including passwords and access codes.
 Tele

 Users
 Adhere to the telephone communications policy 
that requires them 
not to discuss classified information 
over the tele
phone and to exercise care when discussing sensitive information
 The following vulnerabilities of unsecured telephone systems can result in unintentional 
transmission of classified or sensitive information
.  Commonly accepted best practices dictate 
that u
sers be made aware of these vulnerabilities and exercise extreme caution when discussing 
sensitive information on unsecured phones
.  Unsecured phones 
are
 never
 used to discuss 
classified information.
  Telephones that are on
-hook can intercept voice commun
ications by design, 
by 
modification
, or 
by 
attachment of monitoring devices.
  Cordless telephones generate signals that can be monitored.
  Speakerphones can pick up nearby conversations containing sensitive material.
  Telephone answering devices can be access
ed to retrieve sensitive information.
  Call forwarding options can be used to redirect sensitive m
essages.
  Improperly configured or physically unsecured PBXs and 
computerized 
telephone 
systems 
(CTS) can allow interception of sensitive voice communications.
 The risks that these vulnerabilities present 
justify the policy restricti
ng the
 use of telephones
.  The basic telephony concepts behind these vulnerabilities are bey
ond the scope of this document
.  Restricting the use of desktop equipment (e.g., cordless t
elephones, speakerphones, answering 
devices, call forwarding options, etc.) in areas where sensitive information will be discussed 

mitigates some of the risks associa
ted with these vulnerabilities
.  Following the procedures and 
guidance in NIST SP 800
-24, PBX Vulnerabil
ity Analysis:
 Finding Holes in Y
our PBX before 
Someone Else Does,
 will mitigate others
.  Finally, where telephones must be used to discuss 
sensitive information, additional guidance can be obtained from the NSA and DOD regarding 

telephone m
odels that reduce or eliminate the vulnerabilities listed in this section.
 4.4.3 Voice Mail
 Sensitive information is not to be stored 
on voice mail systems
.  Since secure 
email
 is a
vailable, 
voice mail should be authorized only by exception for personnel whose r
esponsibilities require it.
 Since it is possible to perform traffic analysis or denial of service attacks on telephone systems 

by abusing voice mail, any user of voice mail should enable password pro
tection for voice mail 

access
.  Voice mail passwords shou
ld have no fewer than 
four
 (4) 
characters, and no 
cons
ecutively repeated characters
.  Passwords should be changed at least every 
ninety (

needed to mitigate the risks associat
ed with 
those 
vulnerabilities
.  Data communications 
include 
telecommunications, video teleconferencing, and voice over data 
network technology.
 4.5.1 Telecommunications Protection Techniques
 Extreme caution should be exercised when telecommunications protection techniques are being 
considered as alternatives 
to the use of encryption
.  While such technologies may represent a 

lower
-cos
t approach, their ability to protect information may not provide an
 adequate level of 
protection
.  During the procurement process, emphasis must be placed on the effectiveness of the 

tool or approach selected.
 Except in low

 102 Although sensitive data may be contained entirely within a protected network, there still exists 
the possibility that a disgruntled, malicious
, or subversive individual may be able to access 
sensit
ive data by means of
 devices or software that capture data traveling across the network
.  This is often accomplished by sniffing software
, which uses low
-level driver commands to 
put 
a Network Interface Card (NIC) into promiscuous mode
.  Normally, network 
interface cards only 
accept information directed to them and ignore information th
at does not have their address
.  A promiscuous NIC collects all information from the network to which it is attached, regardless of 

the intended address.
 Tools 
for 
detecting 
NICs that 
are
 in a promiscuous mode
 are available
.  The scanning of systems 
referred to in Section 5.4.8, 
Testing and Vulnerability 
Management
, can detect software 
programs that are capable of enabling this mode
.  Scanning tools can also detect software 
operating in promiscuous mode when it is collecting data from a NIC.
 A malicious individual can make information unavailable by rendering the network unusable
.  This is commonly known as a d
enial of service (DoS) attack
.  An individual can initiate a DoS 
attack by broadcasting large amounts of data, by physically compromising network 
element
s, or 
by taking advantage of some of the inherent weaknesses of 
the
 Transmission Control 
Protocol/Internet Protocol
 (TCP/IP
) handshaking process.
 Intrusion detection sys
tem tools exist that can detect most types of DoS attacks
 (see Section 
5.4.4, Firewalls
).  Proper configuration of server systems can also mitigate these attacks by 
altering the default TCP/IP software configuration settings.
 Additional vulnerabilit
ies e
xist with 
respect to the accuracy of the information transmitted
.  There is a
 class of attacks known 
as man in the middle
. In these attacks, an individual receives 
information, alters it, and transmits the altered information to its originally intended r
ecipient in 
such a manner that the recipient believes that the information was sent directly 
from the original 
destination
.  These attacks can be mitigated through the use of message digests
.  Message digests 
calculate a fixed length 
value from any amount 
of text
.  This fixed length value is ve
ry difficult 
to reproduce
.  Also, encryption and digital signing make the task of altering data difficult or 
sufficiently time consuming that it is of little use.
 NIST SP 800
-13, Telecommunications Security Guideline
s for Telecommunications 
Management Network
, outlines these and other security consideration
s involving 
telecommunications
.  NIST contends that 65
 percent
 of the compromises regarding availability, 
integrity and privacy/
 confidentiality are committed by e
mployees through errors, omissions
, and 
malicious acts.
 Establishment by Components of alternate telecommunications services is required by 
DHS 
Sensitive Systems Policy Directive 4300A, Section 4.5.1.
 4.5.2 Facsimiles
 Facsimile
 (fax)
 technology was developed for
 scanning and transmitting documents
.  Although f
ax is traditionally a telephony
-based application, the technology has evolved to address the 
transmission of text or image files
. Fax inherently is not a secure means of communication, and faxes can easily 
be intercepted and 
decoded
.  Fax protocols provide neither authentication nor non
-repudiation services
, which 
allows fax traffic to be sent to or received by 
unintended 
recipients
.  The commonly used Group 
III fax protocol implements support for proprietary
 and undocumented data exchange using a 
DHS 4300A SENSITIVE 
SYSTEMS 
HANDBOOK
  v12.0, November 15, 2015
 103 feature called 
Nonstandard 
Facilities (NSF)
.  Fax servers or fax modems attached to networks 
provide a potential means for network intrusion and penetration.
 Several proactive steps must be taken to ensure adherence 
to DHS fa
x po
licy
.  This policy is 
designed to prevent unauthorized paths into the protected network, commonly referred to as 
backdoors. For example, fax polli
ng features must be disabled
.  Fax polling allows a remote 
fax machine to access a fax machin
e and retrieve any data in 
memory waiting to be delivered.
 Any fax machine used to transmit sensitive information should be placed in a locked room that 

only trusted individuals 
are able to 
access
.  The fax machine should also be placed in such a 
fashion t
hat any documents being sent or retrieved are not visible to 
non-trusted individuals.
 Anyone sending sensitive information should verify the recipients secure fax number 

immediately before sending and should ascertain whether or not the intended recipient
 (or trusted 
subordinate) will be present to receive the fax as soon as it is sent.
 Sensitive information should never be sent to an unattended fax machine
.  Fax 
machine
s should 
have the
 memory features turned off, so that the information cannot be acces
sed or 
retransmitted (possibly to an 
unauthorized 
recipient) at a later time.
 All documents being transmitted should be appropriately labeled (see Sections 4.3.2 and 4.11 of 

this handbook)
.  The reverse procedure should be used if the individual is receivi
ng.  All 
documents transmitted or received should be immediately removed from the fax machine room 

and appropriately stored.
 Extremely sensitive or classified faxes require more stringent controls, such as transmission over 

trusted links (as opposed to the
 Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN))
.  If such a fax 
must be sent via the PSTN, 
use of 
encryption devices 
is required
. Because a fax machine is operated in a similar manner to a copying machine, transmission of 

extremely sensitive or classified data 
should be followed by using the machine in copier mode to 

process several copies of a test pattern or some unclassified data to remove the image of the 

sensitive data from the fax machines imaging apparatus.

 4.5.3 Video Teleconferencing
 Video teleconferencing permits DHS personnel to engage in live exchanges of information 
without the lost time and high cost of traveling to attend a face
-to-face me
eting in a distant city
.  Video teleconferencing offers many beneficial applications, including training and distance 

learning, data collaboration, large and small meetings, and informational broadcasts.
 Two basic mechanisms allow video teleconferencing to
 take place
.  The most basic uses 
professional quality video equipment, which displays remotely on television monitors or similar 

projection devices
.  The second uses inexpensive video devices, which are attached to computers 
and display on computer screen
s using protocols such as H.323 over IP networks
.  The 
transmission medium for both can be within a protected network, across the PSTN or across an 

internal or external (Internet) network connection.
 The first approach allows the equipment to be controlled
, operated, and secured by trusted 

individuals with specific responsibilities for the teleconferencing equipment
.  Operators can 
assure that any recording of information is labeled and secured according to its sensitivity (see 

Section 4.3.2), properly disp
osed of when no longer useful (see Section 4.3.3), and secured 

during transmission by use of proper encryption (see Section 5.5.1) or tunneling
.  They can also 
confirm that the broadcast information is being sent to the proper location
.  It is recommended 
that, to the degree possible, such conferences occur in a point
-to-point manner between two sites.
 The second approach is not authorized
.  This technology introduces all of the vulnerabilities 

associated with sensitive data transmission across an IP networ
k (see Section 4.5.1
 of this 
handbook
), as well as the vulnerabilities associated with other devices, which may unwittingly 

make sensitive data available to unauthorized parties (see Sections 4.4.2 and 4.6.3)
.  The ability 
of an individual to easily eavesd
rop on such communications or record them on media for 

improper dissemination is an unnecessary risk.
 The design of the video teleconferencing 
system 
and facility must be approved by the 
DHS 

CISO before purchase and installation.
  Components 
must
 develop s
tandard operating procedures 
for the operations and maintenance of this capability
.  These procedures must specify that:
  All participants must have the appropriate clearance and need
-to-know
  Video conferencing must be disabled when not in use
  Any videotape
s created of the teleconference must be appropriately labeled with the highest 
classification of the information contained on the videotape and secured in accordance with 

established media controls

 4.5.4 Voice 
over 
Data Networks
 Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and similar technologies move voice over digit
al networks
.  These technologies use protocols originally designed for data networking
.  Such technologies 
include Voice over Frame Relay, Voice over Asynchronous Transfer Mode, and Voice over 
Digital Subscriber Line
 (refer to NIST SP 800
-58 for further in
formation).
 Voice over data 
networking 
cannot yet be considered a mature technology
.  Although various 
standards are currently being 
published
, there is little assurance that systems that incorporate 

these capabilities can be adequately protected
.  Moreove
r, there are hidden costs associated with 
their use that make their implementation suspect on technical grounds other than security 

considerations
.  These include interoperability issues
.  Although not prohibited, implementation 
of these technologies is di
scouraged.
 Prior to implementing voice over data network technology, Components must conduct rigorous 

risk assessments and security testing and provide Department business justification for their use
.  Furthermore, any systems that employ this technology m
ust be 
authorized 
for 
use
 with residual 
risks clearly identified
. Redundancy can be accomplished by establishing major (trunk) links in a load balancing fashion
.  
This concept involves having multiple pathways
 that 
appear to be a single pathway in terms of
 addressing or routing
.  If one of the alternate pathways fails, the share of traffic that it was handling 
is distributed to the other pathways
.  If there is only one other pathway, the situation is known as 
fail over
.  Such a failure should show an indica
tion on the network monitoring tools
.  Technicians 
could then be dispatched to repair the failed 
element
 and return the link to full operation.

the 
interception of conversations over telephones requires insertion of a monitoring device; the 

interception of cell
ular communications does not, and information transmitted by cellular phones 
can be intercepted

unauthorized recipients (see Section 4.6.2.1).
 Text messages rely on the service providers network and are not encrypt
ed.  There is thus no 
assurance of the security of these services
.  Moreover, text
-message devices can be spammed 
until the users mailbox is full.

 4.6.2.3 Multifunctional
 Wireless Devices
 Wireless devices have evolved to be multifunctional (cell phones, pagers, and radios can surf the 
Internet, retrieve email, take and transmit pictures).  Most of these functions do not have 

suffic
ient s
ecurity.
 Where there
 is a strong business justification for their use, DHS
-owned wireless devices can be 
equipped to allow synchronization with approved 
Department
 owned computers
.  Data is 
encrypted or decrypted, as needed, for synchronization with 
computer
-based 
personal 
information 
managers (PIMs) and other programs.
 The risk assessment for multifunctional wireless devices 
must in all cases
 include an assessment 
of the risks associated with all functions, including IR, RF, and video
.  The 
AO may al

use of multifunctional wireless devices b
ased on the sensitivity and classification of the data and 
the associated risk
s. Use of peripheral devic
es must be tightly controlled
.  Audio and video recording capabilities 
should be prohibited unless spec
ifically requir

 4.6.2.4 Bluetooth
 DHS Sensitive Systems Policy Directive 4300A allows the use of Bluetooth wireless technology 
but requires strict controls
 as specified in Section 4.6.2.4 of DHS Sensitive Systems Policy 
Directive 4300A.  
 4.6.3 Wireless
 Tactical
 Systems
 Wireless tactical systems include 
LMR subscriber devices, infrastructure equipment, remote 
sensors, and technical investigative communications systems
.  Because they are often deployed 
under circumstances in which officer safety and mission succes
s are at stake, wireless tactical 
systems require even greater security measures
.  To ensure secure tactical communications, 
Components must implement strong identification, authentication, and encryption protocols 

designed specifically for each wireless t
actical system.
 Wireless tactic
al system policy and procedures are described more completely in Attachment Q3
, Wireless
 Tactical Systems
, to 
this 
Handbook.
 Wireless tactical communications systems are also subject to issues such as technology 

advances, s
tandard
s, and functional convergence
.  As the use of wireless tactical 
communications systems evolves, Components must develop and implement plans for migration 

to the new technologies
.  AOs must ensure that these migration plans are consistent with DHS 
policy and that appropriate waivers have been obtained.
 LMR systems are the primary means of wireless communications for several 
Component
s.  Security and risk management principles must be included in every phase of the LMR
 system 
development lifecycle
.  LMR network communications traffic should include encryption and 
security controls such as those specified by 
FIPS
 140-2, Security Requirements for 
Cryptographic Modules
, and FIPS 197, 
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
. LMR subscriber units can periodically
 update and rekey encryption protocols manually by using 
a handheld 
Key 
Variable 
Loader (KVL) or automat
ically via

.  With OTAR technology, radios can be rekeyed within seconds over the air from a 
remote location
, all
owing for easier and more regular rekeying, and resulting in improved 
security
.  In addition, the OTAR channel can be used for digital voice transmissions in the 
encrypted mode for emergency interoperability.
 LMR security and policy guidelines and standard
s defined by Project 25 (P25) should be 
implemented where 
appropriate
.  The primary objectives of the P25 standards are to promote 
interoperability among digital or analog LMR equipment used by various levels of 
Government
, support backward compatibility w
ith legacy LMRs, enhance spectrum efficiency, a
nd maximize 
economies of scale
.  All DHS LMRs 
must
 be built on P25
-compliant platforms or 
be 
capable of 
interfacing with P25

 RFID enables wireless identification of objects over significant distances.  Because of the 
computing limitations of RFID tags, it often is not feasible to implement 
many of the security 

mechanisms
 such as cryptography and strong authentication that are commonly supported on 
personal workstations, servers, and network infrastructure devices.  RFID security controls can 

support Departmental and Component privacy objectives, mitigate risks to business processes, 

and prevent the disclosure of sensitive data.

s. 
Wireless communications are highly vulnerable to interception and monitoring.  
DHS employees 
overseas 
must be informed of the risks and the appropriate precautions they should follow when 

using wireless devices overseas
.  Use of secure wireless devices overseas must be approved by 
the DHS CISO.

 Equipment security encompasses workstations, laptops, other mobile computing devices, 
personally owned equipment, and the maintenance of these items.  
This section addresses the use 

and maintenance of computer equipment and stresses the importance of individual accountability 

in protecting these resources.
 System administrators and ISSOs must ensure that all users are educated in the proper 

procedures for logging off and for configuring screen savers.  
Specific procedu
res for logging 
off, locking workstations, and enabling password-
protected screensavers are published in
 Att
achment I to this Handbook, 
Workstation Logon
.   
The following guidelines apply to the protection of workstations used to process or store 

sensiti
ve information:
  Workstations must be adequately protected from theft. 
 Only licensed and approved operating systems and applications 
may 
be used on DHS 
workstations. 
 All default vendor or factory-set administrator accounts and passwords must 
be changed 

befo
re installation or use.
  All equipment is to
 be marked with the highest level of classification of information that has 
ever been processed or stored on the device, if there are any devices authorized for 
processing National Security information in the vici
nity.
  Equipment must be housed in facilities authorized to process sensitive information. 
4.8.1 Workstations 
All users must be instructed to log off or lock their workstation any time the workstation is left 

unattended.  As an added precaution, users should also 
use a password
-protected screensaver
.  The screensaver should activate after no more than 
fifteen 
(1

 4.8.2 Laptop Computers
 and Other Mobile Computing Devices
 DHS 
reli
es heavily on laptop computers
 and other mobile computing devices
.  The mobility of 
these devices 
has increased the productivity of the workforce, but at the same time
, mobility
 has
 increased the risk of theft
 and 
unauthorized data disclosure
.  It is impor
tant to employ additional 
measures to protect these resources includ
ing
 laptops and other 
mobile computing devices
 and 
the data
 they store and 
process
. The increased risk of theft of laptop computers and other mobile computing devices 
presents 
both securit
y and cost 
concerns
.  Both hardware replacement and restoration of data entail 
significant cost.
 The risk of data disclosure is also a major security concern
.  Care must be taken 
to guard against theft at all times
, and 
fundamental security principles must
 be 
observed with 
mobile computing devices
.  For example, 
the 
users password should never be written down and 
stored with the device.
 Mobile computing devices cannot be connected to DHS networks or systems unless 
such 
connections are authorized to 
the net
work or system
.  The 
security 
plan must identify the devices 
that can be used to access the network or system, the purposes for the access, and the security 

controls to be employed for the connection
.  Any laptop computers or other mobile computing 

devices
 that process sensitive data (whether or not they are connected to a DHS network) must 
employ virus protection
.  All removable media must be scanned prior to use to ensure 
it is 
free
 of 
malware

 4.8.6 Wireless Settings for Peripheral Equipment
 Peripheral equipment (printers, scanners, fax machines) often includes capabilities, intended to 
allow wireless access to these devices.  Although convenient, wirel
ess access comes with 
additional risks.  In general, wireless access is not allowed on DHS networks. 
4.9 Department Information Security Operations
 The DHS 
Security
 Operations Center (SOC) is the central coordinating and reporting authority 
for all Sensitive a
nd National Security computer security incidents throughout the Department.  
The Homeland Secure Data Network (HSDN) SOC report
s incidents to the DHS 
SOC
 through 
appropriate channels to protect data classification.  The HSDN SOC is subordinate to the DHS 
SOC, acting as the central coordinating and reporting authority for all SECRET computer 
security incidents throughout the Department. 
Attacks
 against automated systems 
continue to increase 
dramatically
.  As reliance on computer 
resources has increased, the 
systems 
themselves
 have become more vulnerable to attack, viruses, 
system failure, and user error.  
Attacks have been launched against 
many 
organizations and have 
occurred regardless of the sensitivity and criticality of the data being processed.
 Incidents
 can be accidental or malicious
, and they can be caused by outside intruders or internal 
personnel, causing significant disruption of 
mission critical business processes
 and computer-
supported operations; t
hese incidents can severely disrupt computer
-supported operations, 
compromise the confidentiality of sensitive information
; 
and diminish the integrity of critical 
data.
 The effects of security incidents can range from embarrassment
 to interruption of service to 
inability to function, and, potentially, to loss of human life.  
A significant concern is that hostile 

individuals or foreign states could severely damage or disrupt critical operations, resulting in 

harm to the public welfare.  
DHS 
maintain
s a security incident reporting and handling capability 
to help combat the disruptive short and long-
term effects of security incidents.
 OMB M

orting
 The 
HSDN SOC operates as a separate component, though subordinate to the DHS 
SOC
, in a 
similar manner to the Component SOCs.
 4.9.1.1 DHS 
SOC
 Organization
 The 
DHS 
SOC
 reports to the DHS CIO
; the DHS CIO and 
DHS 
CISO provide senior 
management guidance and dir
ection to the 
DHS 
SOC
.  The 
DHS 
SOC
 provides guidance to 
Component SOCs.
 4.9.1.2 Logging 
and Monitoring
 The 
DHS 
SOC
 maintain
s visibility into security operations by using logging
 and monitoring
.  The 
DHS 
SOC
 logging strategy can be broken into two main 
element
s:  real
-time Security

SYSTEMS 
HANDBOOK
  v12.0, November 15, 2015
 127 Incident Management (SIM) logging and monitoring
; and archive logging designed for offline 
processing and later retrieval in th
e event of a security incident.
 Effective DHS security event logging capability requires SOC and 
element
 asset
 integration, 
requisite event visibility, retention, storage considerations and direction for 
element
s to provide 
logging events into the 
DHS 
SOC
 toolset and relevant security policy reference.
 Department logging guidance is documented in the DHS Logging S
trategy
 in the DHS Security 
CONOPS
. 4.9.1.3 Authority and Management
 Security operations oversight and management is inherently a 
Governmental responsibility, not 
one that can be outsourced solely to contractors
.  While a Component SOC may 
contract for 
security op
eration capabilities, the responsibility and ultimate authority must lie with a 
Government
 employee
.  The 
Governmental authority, commonly assigned 
as 
a Federal SOC 
manager
, and one or more Watch Officers, must have the ability to make decisions on behalf 
of 
the 
Government 
in response
 to the ever
-changing cyber threat landscape
.  This is not an authority 
that can be delegated
.  The 
Federal SOC manager and at least one 
Government Watch Officer must be cleared to 
Top 
Secret/Specially Compartmented Information
 (TS/SCI
).  Ideally all Watch Officers will be 
TS/SCI cleared
.  Such clearance
 is necessary to receive threat intelligence updates at 
Top Secret 
(TS) and above.
 Because 
cyber operations are a 
continuous
 activity, 
Government 
authority must be 
continuously 
available
.  This 
is 
commonly is handled 
by three or more 
Watch 
Officers on an 
eight 
hour shift 
rotation, or 
by Government 
authority passed from one SOC to another to cover their watch area 
during off
-hour operations
.  A DHS Watch Area must never be without 
Government 
oversight
. 4.9.1.4 Forensics
 Forensics is the examination of computer systems and the digital information created and 
stored on such systems to extract and analyze evidence in support of an investigation.
6 Whenever a system compromise occurs, a compu
ter forensic investigation will reveal whether or 
not the network or system has 
become a target of criminal action or has 
been used in the 
commission a crime
.  Forensic investigation 
can 
protect against future incidents by revealing 
vectors and methods of 
intrusion
, thus suggesting measures which can be taken 
to protect against 

future incidents.
 The 
DHS 
SOC
, in cooperation with involved Components, will conduct forensic examinations as 
deemed necessary
 in accordance with the incident response guidelines det
ailed in 
Incident 
Response, 
Attachment F
 to this Handbook
. In response to an incident requiring computer forensics, t
he 
DHS 
SOC
 will coordinate support 
from Components 
that have 
appropriate capabilities
.

 128 Any investigation that reveals potential criminal 
activity must be turned over to the appropriate 
authority
.  Forensic investigations will normally consist of thr
ee tiers, as 
shown 
in Table 
2, Forensic Investigations 
Tiers
. Tier
 Action
 Resolution
 Tier 1
 The Component or 
DHS 
SOC
 initiates the investigatio
n The Component or 
DHS 
SOC
 completes the 
investigation 
using 
their own capabilities, expertise, 
and authority.
 Tier 2
 Component or 
DHS 
SOC
 investigators contact the 
DHS 
SOC
 Forensics Response Team 
for procedural, legal, or forensic 
capability
 and 
advice a
s necessary.
  In cases where no criminal activity is found, SOC 

investigators will complete their investigation and 
report results to the 
DHS 
SOC
.  Because the nature 
and complexity of investigations varies, it is 
impossible to establish a standard timelin
e for 
completion
.  Investigators must complete 
investigations as quickly as possible, without 

sacrificing thoroughness
.  Status updates 
are
 provided 
to the 
DHS 
SOC
 during the weekly conference call.
 Tier 3
 DHS 
SOC
 investigators discover 
potential criminal
 activity and 
pass the investigation to the 

appropriate authority after 

coordinating with the DHS CIO 
and CISO.
 In cases of potential criminal activity, investigators 
will notify the Forensics Response Team and defer 
investigation management to the 
Team
.  The 
Team 
lead will assume responsibility for the investigation 
based on the nature suspected criminal activity
.  Component and 
DHS 
SOC
 investigators will provide 
expertise as appropriate.

 4.9.1.5 Vul
nerability Management
 Vulnerability management is a combination of detection, assessment, and mitigation of 
systematic 
weaknesses
.  Vulnerabilities may be 
revealed by
 a number of sources, including 
reviews of previous risk assessments
; audit reports
; vulne
rability lists
; security advisories
; and 
system security testing 
(such as automated vulnerability scanning 
and 
Security Control 
Assessment
). The 
DHS 
SOC
 takes a proactive approach to vulnerability management including detecting 
vulnerabilities through test
ing, reporting through 
Information Security Vulnerability 
Management (
ISVM
) messages, and conducting 
Vulnerability 
Assessments 
(VA).
 A core element of vulnerability management is mitigating the discovered vulnerabilities, based 

on a risk management strateg
y.  Such a 
strategy accounts for vulnerability severity, threats, and 
assets at risk
.   Risk calculation allows Components to prioritize remediation actions, in accordance with 

specific situations and risk management strategies
.  Remediation actions are ca
ptured in each 
Components patch management policy.
 4.9.1.6 Information Security Vulnerability Management
 (ISVM)
 The 
DHS 
SOC
 will stay abreast of current system vulnerabilities and provide recommendations 
to Components through ISVM messages
.  The 
DHS 
SOC
 will forw
ard advisories from US
-DHS 4300A SENSITIVE 
SYSTEMS 
HANDBOOK
  v12.0, November 15, 2015
 129 CERT, as appropriate, and ensure that each Component is alerted
.  In cases where the alert, 
advisory or warning is time
-critical, the 
DHS 
SOC
 may also inform each DHS Component CIO 
and
 Point 
of 
Contact 
(POC
) via telephone
.  The Compo
nent POCs will be asked to reply to the 
DHS 
SOC 
within a specified time period 
in 
instances requiring response to external 
organizations.
 ISVM m
essages 
to Components 
can be of
 three forms:
  Information Security Vulnerability Alert (ISVA)
  Information Securit
y Vulnerability Bulletin (ISVB)
  Technical Advisory (TA)
 The 
kinds 
of vulnerabilities, messages

 4.9.3 Definitions and Incident Categories
 A security event is a notable but unassessed occurrence that may affect a computing or 
telecommunications system or network
.  Security e
vents 
may result from intentional or 
uninten
tional actions and may include inappropriate use of DHS 
information 
resources
.  An 
event 
can become
 an incident after it has been assessed
.  The assessment process may be 
performed by the DHS Help Desk, a Component 
SOC
, or the 
DHS 
SOC, depending upon its 
nature and 
the 
circumstances
.  Events are investigated individually, but the Help Desk and 
SOC
s also review them globally for patterns and tendencies that could identify system vulnerabilities.
 An 
information
 security incident is an assessed security event
.  It may even be a simple, 
inadvertent situation that can be rectified by employee training
.  Security incidents include the 
inappropriate use of DHS computer resources
.  Examples include:
  Use of Internet sites that result in an additional charge to the Go
vernment
  Obtaining, viewing, or transmitting sexually explicit material or other material 
inappropriate to the workplace, which might be considered to contribute to a hostile work 
environment for some employees
  Use for other than official Governmental busi
ness that results in significant strain on 
Department computer systems (e.g., mass mailings or sending or downloading large files 
such as programs, pictures, video files, or games)
  Any otherwise prohibited activity, such as sending out solicitations or eng
aging in 
political activ
ity prohibited by the Hatch Act
 Sometimes, the security incident is a clear violation of an explicit or implied security policy 
that 

applies to a 
computing or telecommunications system or network
.  DHS has identified several 
DHS 4300A SENSITIVE 
SYSTEMS 
HANDBOOK
  v12.0, November 15, 2015
 131 categor
ies of computer security incident and defined them in Attachment F
 to this Handbook
.  Examples include:
  Unauthorized attempts to gain access to information
  Introduction of malicious co
de or viruses into an 
information
 system
  Loss
 or theft of computer media
 Categories of incidents include the following:
  Unauthorized Access (Intrusion)
:  Unauthorized access includes all successful 
unauthorized accesses and suspicious unsuccessful attempts
.  Denial of Service
 (DoS)
:  DoS
 attacks include incidents that affect th
e availability of 
critical resources such as email servers, Web servers, routers, gateways, or 
communications infrastructure
.  Malicious Logic
:  Malicious logic includes active code such as viruses, Trojan horses, 
worms, and scripts used by crackers/hackers
 to gain privileges and/or information, 
capture passwords, 
or modify audit logs 
to hide unauthorized activity
.  Misuse
:  Misuse occurs when a
 user violates Federal laws or regulations and/or 
Department policies regarding proper use of computer resources
; installs unauthorized or 
unlicensed software
; or 
accesses resources or privileges that are greater than those 
assigned
.   PII 
incident
:  PII i
ncidents 
are suspected 
or confirmed breaches of
 personally identifiable 
information in electronic or physical form
 and are categorized by the manner in which the 
PII incident occurred (e.g., Alteration/Compromise of Information, Unauthorized Access 
(Intrusion), Misuse).  
The DHS SOC Online Reporting System has specific questions that 

relate to PII incidents, which should
 be completed in their entirety
.   Probes and Reconnaissance 
Scans
:  These i
nclude
 probing or scanning networks for 
critical services or security weaknesses
; this category a
lso include
s nuisance scans
.  Classified System Incident
:  Any incident that involves
 a system used to process national 
security information
.  Altera
tion/Compromise of Information
:  Any incident that involves the unauthorized 
altering of information, or any incident that involves the compromise of information
. 4.10 Documentation
 Documentation of
 information
 systems involves collection of detailed information
 in areas
 including functionality, system mission, unique personnel requirements, type
s of data processed, 
architectur
e, system interfaces, system boundaries, hardware and software 
element
s, s
ystem and 
network diagrams, cost of assets, system communications and facilities, and any additional 

system
-specific information
.  This information represents the foundation of the 
systems 
configuration baseline
.  All proposed changes to the configuration
 baseline must be analyzed and 
tested to determine 
whether or not 
they
 have 
any 
security 
implications
.  All proposed 
configuration changes to operating systems
 must be analyzed, as must 
operating system security 
features, applications, critical system file
s, and system devices
.  Changes must be approved

 The software, firmware, algorithms, data structures, processes, and other design mechanisms that 
satisfy a set of documented security requirements 
make up 
the systems security baseline
.  Security 
element
s of operational systems should be set to the
ir most restrictive mode prior to 
placing the system into the operational environment
. Adequate records of changes to the configuration or security baseline must be maintained for 
each system
.  A historical log of changes for all previous configurations must be maintained
.  Periodic configuration reviews 
are
 conducted in conjunction with periodic risk assessments.

 4.11 Information and Data Backup
 Adhering to requirements regarding data backups can significantly reduce the risk that data will 
be compromised or lost in the event of a disaster or interruption o
f service
.  A Backup 
Operations Plan must be included in the Contingency Plan
 (CP)
, as discussed in Section 3.5.
2, Information Technology 
Contingency Planning
. Development of a data backup strategy begins early in the 
system 
life cycle when 
the 
criticali
ty and sensitivity
 of the system 
are 
first considered
.  The following factors (derived from the Risk 
Assessment and documented in the 
CP) drive the data backup strategy:
  Application restoration priorities based on DHS mission criticality

SYSTEMS 
HANDBOOK
  v12.0, November 15, 2015
 133  The maximum

degraded
  The 
number 
of data updates that can be lost between a service interruption event and the 
last data backup
  The 
number 
of changes in system configuration settings that can be lost between 
a 
service interruption event and the last data backup
  Interdependencies with other systems
  Identity of the
 System Owner
s Elements that must be considered as part of the backup operations strategy include:
  Specific needs of the site
  People
: their roles, res
ponsibilities, and skill levels
  Hardware requirements
  Communications considerations
  Supplies required
  Location and availability of an alternate processing site
  Transportation requirements
  Space requirements of the recovery site
  Power and environmental requ
irements
  Backup documentation requirements
 The frequency of backups will depend upon how often the data processed by the system(s) 
changes and how important 
the 
changes are
.  The risk assessment will drive this element of the 

backup strategy
.  Data backups
 must be
 stored both on
-site and off
-site, in secure facilit
ies
, in 
firepr
oof and waterproof containers.
 Data backup and restoration procedures must be tested regularly as an integral part of 
the overall 

Contingency Plan
.  Backup copies 
are
 tested 
to make 
sure they are ac
tually usable for 
restoration
.  More frequent testing may be required
, commensurate with the risk and magnitude 
of loss or harm that could result from disruption of i
nformation processing support
.  Testing 
helps ensure that each person with
 data backup responsibilities understands and is able to 

technically fulfill 
their
 backup and recovery duties
.  Testing of data backup and restoration 
procedures 
must be
 formally documented and records of testing 
must be
 retained 
as part of the 
system hist
ory.
 The same principles that govern backup of system data also apply to i
ndividual users
.  Virtually 
all DHS employees and contractors will frequently possess critical sensitive data resid
ing
 on hard drives on Government
-owned 
computers or laptops
.  Hard 
drive crashes combined with 
failure to save critical files can result in a negative impact 
on the DHS mission or, at a minimum, 

can 
result in additional costs and lost time to r
ecover or duplicate lost data
.  Critical data should 
never be kept on individua
l hard drive
s unless a backup copy exists
.  The backup should 
preferably be stored on a network drive wh
ere frequent backups are made
.  DHS system

 4.12 Converging Technologies 
Advances in technology have resulted in the availability of devices that offer multiple functions.  
Many devices such as multifunctional desktop computers, copiers, facsimile machines, and 

Heating
, Ventilation 
and A
ir Conditioning (HVAC) systems may contain sensitive data and 
may 
also be connected to data communications networks. 
The use of nontraditional 
information systems elements
 without appropriate safeguards presents 
risks to DHS organizations in part because these devices are typically not thought of as 
information syste
ms. Wireless devices must be secured as specified in Section 4.6, Wireless Communications.  

Copiers with the capability to process sensitive documents must be secured in the same manner 

as facsimile machines (see Section 4.5.2)
.  Sanitization of media incl
uded in copiers (or other 
devices) must be carried out in the manner prescribed in Section 4.3.3, Media Sanitization and 

Disposal.  If the device is a multifunction device, the fax functions must be secured in the same 

manner as stand
-alone fa
x 
machines
.  Printing functions must be secured in accordance with the 
provisions 
of 
Section 4.3.4, Production, Input/Output Controls. 
HVAC, fire suppression, and power equipment (including emergency power backup) 
must

 137 5.0 TECHNICAL CONTROLS
 The design of information systems that process, store, or transmit sensitive information 
is 
required to 
include the automated security features discussed in this section
.  Security safeguards 
must be in place to ensure that each person ha
ving access to sensitive information systems is 
individually accountable for his or her actions while utilizing the system. 
Technical controls
 are
 security controls that a computer system executes
.  These controls can 
provide automated protection 
from 
unau
thorized access or misuse
; 
facilitate detection of security 
violations; and support security requirements for applications and data. 
5.1 Identification and Authentication
 Identification 
is the process of telling a system the identity of a subject
.  Usually this is done by 
entering a name or presenting a token to the system via a 
Smart Card
.  The identity of each user 
must be established prior to authorizing 
access to the 
system
, and each system user must have 
his 
or her own unique User ID.  
Personal Identificat
ion 
Verification (
PIV) credentials, or alternative 
solutions that provide NIST SP 800-
63 Level of Assurance (LOA) 4 of the users identity are the 
primary means of logical authentication for DHS sensitive systems.
 NIST SP 800
-63 states that a username, pas
sword, and single factor one-
time password (such as 
RSA SecurID) is not LOA 4 compliant.   
Authentication
 is the process of proving that a subject is who the subject claims to be.  
Authentication is a measure used to verify the eligibility of a subject and
 the ability of that 
subject to a
ccess certain information
.  There are three 
methods of authenticating:   
 Something you know (e.g., password) 
 Something you have (e.g., a 
Smart Card
) 
 Something you are (e.g., a biometric such as a fingerprint)
 DHS systems mu
st be designed to ensure that each user is authenticated prior to being allowed 
access
.  Concurrent logins to the same system or application using the same authentication 
credentials are not allowed, unless a specific business or operational need is documented and 
approved by the 
Authorizing Official (
AO). 
Identification
 and authentication responsibilities are provided in the following table

5.1.1  Passwords 
The least expensive method for authenticating users is a password system in which 
authentication is performed each time a password is used.  More sophisticated authentication 

techniques, such as Smart Cards and biological recognition systems (e.g., retina scanner, 

handprint, voice recognition), must be cost-justified through the risk assessment process. 
A password is a sequence of characters used for authentication purposes.  Passwords are often 
used to authenticate the identity of a system user and, in some instances, to grant or deny access 

to private or shared data. 
Passwords provide a reasonable degree of authentication and are one of the most common 
methods used for controlling system access.  Passwords are important because they are often the 

first line of defense against intruders or insiders who may be trying to obtain unauthorized access 
to a DHS system.  To be used effectively, policies requiring strong passwords must be 
implemented, and users and system administrators must follow DHS password guidelines. 
The use of a personal passwor
d by more than one individual is prohibited throughout DHS.  It is 
recognized, however, that, in certain circumstances such as the operation of crisis management 
or operations centers, watch team and other duty personnel may require the use of group User 

IDs and passwords. 
5.1.1.1 Selectin
g Strong Passwords 
DHS Sensitive Systems Policy Directive 4300A makes the use of strong passwords mandatory, 

and requires ISSOs to determine and enforce measures to ensure that strong passwords are 
used.
  Therefore, users must select well
-constructed passwords.  The following table contains 
DHS 4300A SENSITIVE 
SYSTEMS 
HANDBOOK
  v12.0, November 15, 2015
 139 guidelines based on DHS policy and US Government Configuration Baseline (USGCB) 
http://usgcb.nist.gov/
 for strong passwords that should be followed throu
ghout the Department
:  Required Action
 Benefit Gained
 Strong passwords :
 Are at least 12 characters 
in length.
 Comply with the DHS hardening 
guides for operating 
systems and the 
configuration guides for applications.  
In the absence of guidance, the ISSO 
will determine the 
appropriate password complexity based on the level of 
risk.
 Are 
not the same as
 any of the users previous 8 

passwords.
  These requirements make it more difficult 
for a password guesser to obtain passwords
.  They increase the set of comb
inations that 
must be guessed and provide a mixture to 
defeat a dictionary attack.
 Strong passwords do not contain any dictionary word.
  Prevents dictionary type of attacks.
 Strong passwords do not contain any proper noun or the 
name of any person, pet, 
child, or fictional character.  
Passwords do not contain any employee serial number, 
Social Security number, birth date, phone number, or 
any information that could be readily guessed about the 
creator of the password.
 Helps prevent a password guess based 
on a 

hackers personal knowledge of the user.
 Strong passwords do not contain any simple pattern of 

letters or numbers, such as qwerty or xyz123.
 Protects against dictionary attacks
  Strong passwords do not contain any word, noun, or 

name spelled bac
kwards or with a single digit 
appended, or with a two
-digit year string, such as 
98xyz123.
 Protects against dictionary attacks
  Strong pass phrases, if used in addition to or instead of 
passwords, follow the same guidelines.
 Consistent application of gu
idelines.
 Strong passwords are not the same as the User ID.  
 Risk of unauthorized access is reduced, as 

hackers initially try obvious passwords 
such as username and User ID.
 5.1.1.2 Results of Weak Passwords
 Hackers have access to a variety of password
-cracki
ng tools.  Weak passwords may allow 
internal or external users or hackers to gain unauthorized access to DHS systems.  
 Brute force attacks involve manual or automated attempts to guess valid passwords.  There are 
numerous password
-guessing programs availa
ble on the Internet.  Most hackers have a 
password hit list, which is a collection of default passwords automatically assigned to various 
DHS 4300A SENSITIVE 
SYSTEMS 
HANDBOOK
  v12.0, November 15, 2015
 140 system accounts.  For example, the default password for the guest account in most UNIX 
systems is guest.
 Many hack
ers will try to guess passwords using a users personal information, such as birth date, 
name of spouse or children, pets, employee ID number, etc.  Hackers will often practice what 

they call social engineering, which involves talking with employees to f
ind out things about 
the systems in their office, and, more importantly, personal information that will help them guess 

passwords. 
Users tend to choose passwords that are easy to remember such as the name of a family member 
or pet, a birth date, or a word that may mean something to the user.  These types of passwords 

are the easiest for others to guess.
 People are the key to constructing good passwords.  Poorly constructed passwords make it easier 

for a hacker to crack the password.  The longer it takes hac
kers to get a password, the more 
likely they are to move on to other methods of gaining access to the system. 
It should be noted that many computer systems use auditing features that keep a record of actions 
initiated by the users while on the system.  Onc
e a hacker cracks a password and gains access to 
the system using the appropriate User ID, the system audit logs record that the User ID was used 

in taking harmful actions on the system.  Authentication is the basis for control and 

accountability of the users on the system. 
5.1.1.3 System Administrator Responsibilities
 System administrator
s should follow the DHS password guidelines 
in the following table 
to 
ensure that password settings are in compliance with DHS requirements. 
A secure method for distribution of pa
sswords is also necessary
.  Administrators must verify an 
individuals identity prior to communicating account or password information.

.  For systems with 
a low impact for the confidentiality security objective, 

consider an account unused if no login has occurred in 
90 days.  
For systems with a mo

 Never set any password equal to the null string, which 
is equivalent to no password at all. 
Follows best security practices.
 Privileged accounts must be secured by authentication technology stronger than tha
t based o
nly 
on a User ID and password
.  All actions taken by 
remote 
privileged users must also be logged for 
auditing purposes and must 
be encrypted to prevent playback attacks
.  All passwords, 
algorithms, keys, certificates, codes, or other schemes used for authentication must 
be 
stored in a 
manner that prevents unauthorized 
access
. 
5.2 Access Control
 Access controls restrict access to objects such as files, directories
, and devices based upon 
users 
identit
ies
 or gr
oups and protect against unauthorized disclosure, modification, or destruction of 
the data
. Automated systems are vulnerable to 
the 
fraudulent or malicious activit
ies
 of individuals who 
have the authority or capability to access information not required to perform their job-
related 
duties.  
Acces
s control policy is designed to reduce the risk of an individual
s engaging in 
fraudulent or malicious behavior 
while acting alone
.  The Principle of Least Privilege states that 
users should only be able to access the system resources needed to fulfill the
ir job 
responsibilities
.  This principle should be considered when granting access. 
Principle of Least Privilege:
  Requires that each user in a system be granted the most 
restrictive set of privileges (or lowest clearance) needed for performance of authorized tasks.
 The application of this principle 
limits the damage that can result from an accident, error, or 
unauthorized use.
 Network
 and system administrators and ISSOs are responsible for ensuring that access controls 
are in place and operating as intended
.  It is especially critical that the authority to add, change,

 devices, dial
-up connections, and network addresses and protocols, or to 
remove or alter programs be tightly controlled
, with access limited to a select group of 
authorized
 personnel.
  Initial User Access
 Users who need access to DHS systems and networks must have completed a background 
investigation prior to being granted access
.  User access will vary depending on the users 
position
.  The users supervisor or 
Project Manag
er must also determine the systems the user 
needs to access and the levels of access the user requires
.  The 
System Owner
 must approve 
user access privileges.
  Review of Access Privileges 
 The data a user needs to access will change over time
.  Therefore, s
upervisors have the 
responsibility to ensure that access control lists are current and up
-to-date
.  This requirement 
also applies to contractors and other non
-DHS personnel with access to any DHS systems
.  ISSOs have an oversight responsibility to ensure t
his is being accomplished
.  These actions 
are reviewed as part of the 
Security Authorization Process 
process and during annual self
-assessments.
 Access control policies and procedures 
are
 written and stored in an off
-site location
.  They 
must to be accessi
ble in the event of an emergency
.  This information also needs to be 
included in the Contingency Plan.
  Terminated and Departing Employees
 System
 and 
Local 
Area 
Network (

) administrators and 
Information Systems Security 
Officers (

) must ensure that a
ll departing employees have their access privileges 
terminated immediately
.  No former employee should have the ability to access system 
resources after their term of employment has ended
.  Procedures vary depending on whether 
the separation is voluntary o
f involuntary
.  Termination of access privileges also applies to 
employees whose job functions have changed such that they no longer require access to the 

level to which they were previously granted
.  See Section 4.1.6, Separation from Duty, for 

additional
 guidance.
  Secure Remote Access
 Hardware security tokens, such as cryptographic smartcards, can be issued to DHS 

employees and contractors who have a valid need to remotely access DHS systems and data.

the ability to track 
the
 activities 
of a 
user who is 
accessing an automated system
.  Trails maintained by a

method of enforcing this
 principle

 activity
. DHS 4300A SENSITIVE 
SYSTEMS 
HANDBOOK
  v12.0, November 15, 2015
 145 With the use of appropriate tools and procedures, auditing can further 
progress toward several 
security
-related objectives including: 
 Individual accountability 
 Intrusion detection 
 Problem identification
  Capability to reconstruct events 
Au
dit trails can track the identity of each subject attempting to access 
a 
system, the time and date 

of access, and
 the 
time of log off
.  A
udit trails can 
also capture all activities performed during a 
session and can specifically identify those activities t
hat have the potential to modify, bypass, or 

negate the systems security safeguards
.  The auditing technique used must be able to support 
after
-the
-fact investigations of how, when, and why normal operations ceased. 
Audit trail records must be maintained 
online for at least 90 
days to
 allow rapid access to recent 
information
.  Audit trails should be preserved for a period of seven years as part of record 
management
 for each system to allow audit information to be placed online for analysis with 
reasonable ease
.  Preservation of the audit information should be part of contingency and 

business continuity plans, so that events preceding a disaster or interruption of service can be 

reconstructed.
 To be effective, audit trails must be periodically reviewed and a
nalyzed
.  The capability to 
review the information captured by the auditing process is of paramount importance.  
In many 
cases, it is only through the review process that incidents of unauthorized access, modification, 

or destruction are uncovered.  Audit trails need to be secured to prevent tampering and 
they must 

be 
backed up regularly.

5.4 Network and Communications Security
 Network security encompasses remote access, network monitoring, external connections, 
boundary protection, Internet usage, 
email
 security
, and vulnerability scanning.  This section 
addresses vulnerabilities inherent in network security and the technical controls needed to 

mitigate the risks associated with these vulnerabilities.
 5.4.1 Remote Access
 and Dial-
In Remote access technology allows trus
ted employees to access DHS networks by dialing in via 
modem or accessing the DHS network via the Internet.  This allows mobile employees to stay in 

touch with the home office while traveling.  
There are significant security risks, however, 
associated with
 remote access and dial
-in capabilities.  Proper procedures 
can help mitigate these 
risks.  . 
Unauthorized 
access is the biggest risk associated with remote access
.  Access by untrusted or 
uncleared persons can violate the Departments confidentiality,
 int
egrity,
 and availability 
standards.  An unsecured modem or other dial-in facility could provide a backdoor to the entire

 5.4.2.1 Intrusion Det
ection Systems (IDS)
 Intrusion detection is the art of detecting inappropriate, inc
orrect, or malicious activity
.  Systems 
that operate on a host to detect malicious activity on that host are called 
Host
-based 
Intrusion 
Detection 
Systems (HIDS)
.  Those tha
t operate on a network are referred to as 
Network 
Intrusion 
Detection 
systems (NIDS)
.  Intrusion detection is viewed as an integral part of a layered security 
model
/defense
-in-depth strategy
. Intrusion detection operates on the principle that any attempt t
o penetrate a system can be 
detected in real time as opposed to actually stopping the penetration, 
as is the case with firewalls
.  This principle is based on the assumption
 that it is virtually impossible to 
block every avenue to 
security breach
.  A NIDS
 is designed to identify break
-in attempts and stop them, in some cases 
working in conjunction with firewalls to alter the access cont
rol lists to halt an incursion
.  A HIDS
 can offer the equivalent of a software firewall installed on the host, stopping or p
reventing 
would
-be intruders.
 Intrusion 
Prevention 
Systems (IPS
) are closely related to IDSs
.  Some IDS technologies currently 
provide intrusion protection by halting malicious data transmissions and disconnecting 

communication from the h
ost from which the
y originate
.  Others take the additional step of 
reconfiguring firewalls to permanently block attacking hosts from 
sending data into the network.
 Firewalls are designed to prevent unauthorized entry
, but f
irewalls can fail or 
be compromised 
by an intruder
.  Intrusion detection systems supplement firewalls by alerting the organization that 
an attack may have occurred or be occurring
.  Firewalls are also incapable of protecting a 
network from internal compromise
, but 
an 
IDS 
can alert network and system manage
rs of such 
an attack
.   5.4.2.2 Intrusion Detection 
Methods and Techniques
 The most common approaches to intrusion detection are statistical anomaly detection and pattern 

matching (signature) detection
.   DHS 4300A SENSITIVE 
SYSTEMS 
HANDBOOK
  v12.0, November 15, 2015
 149 Statistical anomaly involves tracking system use and establ
ishing a baseline of what is normal 
and setting an acceptable range of parameters to whic
h the system normally adheres
.  When the 
system goes beyond the statistical
ly established
 ranges, an intrusion may have o
ccurred and an 
alarm is given
.   Pattern mat
ching is
 simply what its name implies
.  Patterns of known attacks
 are part of the IDS 
database
.  Attack patterns for denial of service attacks, buffer overflow attacks,
 and backdoors 

are well known
.  These are known as signatures
.  When these signatures ar
e detec
ted, an alarm is 
given
.   When alarms are given, those monitoring the IDS investigate to determine if an intrusion has in 

fact o
ccurred and react accordingly
.  Event correlation systems can compare information from 
various security devices and reduc
e the likelihood of unnecessary response to false positives, 
which may arise from an attack signatur
e matching allowed activities
.  Such systems can also 
reduce the likelihood that the monitoring staff is distracted from noticing an actual attack by a 

flurry of alarms raised by r
elatively innocuous activities.
 5.4.2.3 Monitoring
 The DHS 
SOC
 is responsible for 
monitorin
g of DHS systems and networks
.  Upon receipt of an 
alarm, operators 
investigate to determine the va
lidity of the alarm
.  Once 
validity is 
confirmed
, the operator notif
ies
 the ISSO and/or the system admini
strator for corrective action
.  If the 
problem is deemed critical, senior management 
is notified and 
must
 be 
involved 
in determining
 the appropriate course of acti
on. 5.4.3 Netw
ork Connectivity
 A system in
terconnection is the direct connection of two or more information systems for the 
purpose of sharing data and other information resources by passing data between each other via a 
direct system
-to-system interface without human intervention.  Any physical c
onnection that 
allows other systems to share data (pass thru) also constitutes an interconnection, even if the two 

systems connected do not share data between them.  
System interconnections include 

connections that are permanent in nature, connections that
 are established by automated scripts at 
prescribed intervals, and
/or
 connections 
which
 utilize web and 
Service Oriented Architecture 
(SOA
) services.  
System interconnections do not include instances of a user logging on to add or 
retrieve data, nor users 
accessing Web
-enabled applications through a browser.
  External 
connections are defined as system(s) or IP addressable end points that are not under the direct 

control of DHS, systems that have IP addressing not in the DHS addressing scheme (routable and 

non-routable), or system
s that have an authorizing official who is not a DHS employee.
 Use 
Internet Protocol 
version 6 (IPv6) 
 has been mandated by the Office of Management and 
 IPv6, it is recommended that all Components ensure new technology acquisitions 
are able to 

send and receive IPv6 traffic, either through internal testing, or validated against a reputable 

organization, such as the 
U.S. Government version 6 (
USGv6
) Profile and Testing Program.
 A number
 of management, operational, and technical control
s impact network connectivity
.  These include i
dentification and authentication controls, audit logging, integrity controls, and 
periodic reviews of programs
 and 
systems to ascertain 
whether or not 
changes 
have occurred 
that

 5.4.3.1 Interconnection Security Agreements
 (ISA)
 Proper management of network connections is vital to ensur
ing
 the confidentiality, 
integrity, and 
availability of the data processed by a system
.  Interconnections of systems must be established 
in accordance with 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (
NIST
) SP 800

stems
. An 
Interconnection Security Agreement (I
SA) is required whenever the security policies of the 
interconnected systems are not identical 
or 
the systems are not administered by the same entity
 or 
AO.  The ISA documents the security protections on the 
interconnected systems to ensure 
that 
only acceptable transactions are permitted
.  Component personnel must review ISAs as part of

. 5.4.3.2 Trust Zones
 Information and services sharing between the 
DHS 
Security Operations Center (
SOC
) and 
Components occurs through Trust Zones
.  A Trust Zone consists of a group of people, data 
systems, and
 networks subject to a shared security policy or set of rules governing access to data 
and services
.  (For example, a Trust Zone may be set up between different network segments that 
require specific usage policies based on information processed, such as l
aw enforcement 
information.) The 
DHS 
SOC
 must be aware of Component
-security requirements, as defined by 
Trust Zones, to accurately perform 
DHS 
SOC
 duties.
 DHS Trust Zones have the following characteristics:
  The Trust Zone must be 
set of networked hosts pr
otected from unconstrained access by 
one or more security perimeter devices
  There must be a
 basis for placement and configuration of firewalls, Virtual VPN
s, and 
remote access protection devices
  The Trust Zone m
ay consist of a single host, one or more LANs
 at a site, or a group of 
networks connected via a network provider or backbone
  OneNet provides a layer of trust 
by means of 
sub
-netting, firewalls, and other policy 
enforcement mechanisms
  Network Admission Control permits dynamic assignment of information
 systems and 
users to basic Trust Zones.
 Medium and High assurance models are another mechanism 
that permits assignment to Trust Zones
 5.4.4 Firewalls
 and Policy Enforcement Points
 Policy Enforcement Points (PEP) separate Trust Zones as defined in the DHS Securi
ty 
Architecture.  Boundary protection between DH
S and external networks is implemented by 
firewalls at the 
Trusted Internet Connections (
TIC
) and other approved direct system inter
-connections.  DHS TICs are provided by OneNet and monitored by the DHS 
SOC
.  Component 
SOCs may protect DHS
-internal boundaries across Trust Zones.  
 Within 
DHS, boundary protection of 
information system
 resources is accomplished by the 

installation and operation of firewall systems
.  Firewalls, when used in concert with a variet
y of 
additional security controls such as intrusion detection systems, 
data encryption, 
personnel 

background checks, security guards, , and physical security barriers, provide an added level of 

assurance that unauthorized personnel will be unable to access
 the Departments 
automated 
systems.
 By tracking and controlling data,
 and
 deciding whether or not to pass, drop, reject, or encrypt the 
data, firewalls have proven to be an effecti
ve means of securing a network.

 5.4.4.1 Firewall Basics
 A firewall is a system or group of systems that enforce an access contro
l policy between two 
networks
.  The actual means by which this 
is accomplish
ed 
vary 
widely
.  Firewalls
 can 
authenticate the source and destination of a given data path provide 
Network 
Address 
Translation (NAT) and 
Port 
Address 
Translation (PAT) and log all
 traffic passing through them
.  Logging is either done on the machine
 on whi
ch the firewall software runs on, or is logged to a 
separate machine for audit an
d intrusion forensic analysis.
 Firewalls are often associated with filtering devices, which screen incoming (and possibly 
outgoing) data traffic for viruses and malware in the
 form of mobile code
.  By offloading these 
responsibilities to ancillary machines, the firewall can allow higher rates of data transmission.
 Mobile (downloadable) code
 is software that is transmitted from a remote source across a 
network to a local system 
and then executed on that local system (e.g., personal computer, 

wireless mobile device
 mobi
le phone, Internet appliance
, etc.
).  Examples include ActiveX 
controls, Java applets, script run within the browser, and 
Hypertext Markup Language (
HTML
) email
.  Although mobile code is a legitimate method for distributing application software, it is 
most frequently associated with malicious mobile code (e.g., viruses, worms, Trojan horses
), that executes without the permission of or any explicit action by the loc
al systems owner/user.
 Firewalls also have two facets with respect to en
cryption
.  A frequently used mechanism is the 
SSHv2 pro
tocol (Secure Shell version 2)
.  This facility can provide for authentication by a digital 
certificate or two
-factor authenticat
ion mechanism,
 and s
trong encryption
.  Such a connection 
should only be allowed from the protected (internal) side of a firewall, so that unauthorized 

outsiders are unable to affect a change.
 Firewalls often have the capability to implement 
encrypted data 
communications
.  Although this 
approach might be slightly more economical, it is more prudent to have a system that functions 

as a fi
rewall serve a single purpose
.  A separate encryption server behind the firewall is afforded 
the extra protection of
 being 
shielded by 
the 
firewall
.  Encryption
, moreover,
 involves 
use of 
a DHS 4300A SENSITIVE 
SYSTEMS 
HANDBOOK
  v12.0, November 15, 2015
 154 substantial amount of computational power, which would slow down 
the operation of the 
firewall
.  Lastly, if the firewall system is compromised, the encryption facility is not 
automatically 
compromised at the same time.
 NIST SP 800
-10, Keeping Your Site Comfortably Secure: An Introduction to Internet 
Firewalls
, and NIST SP 800
-41, Guidelines on Firewalls and Firewall Policy
, offer guidance 
with respect to firewalls and the functions they 
can serve.
 5.4.4.2 Firewall Deployment
 Firewall systems have been deployed to various DHS sites
, and a
dditional systems are scheduled 
for deployment as part of the continuing effort to provide 
necessary security safeguards.
 Firewalls are not used solely to provide
 boundary prot
ection from the outside world
.  In 
commercial environments, for example, the fiscal processing systems may be protected from the 

remainde
r of the network by firewalls
.  In a similar manner, the 
Department
 can 
use 
firewalls to 
segment systems 
that have various levels of sensitivity, unless they are so classified that 

connection to the network should be prohibited.
 5.4.4.3 Firewall Management
 All firewalls for 
sensitive
 systems 
must
 be under the control of DHS
 and Component
 SOC
s, who 
are 
responsible for
 providing direction and guidance for firewall settings and rule sets
.  The 
actual 
application
 of all firewalls 
is under the 
DHS 
SOC
. 5.4.5 Internet Security
 Section 5.4.5 of DHS Sensitive Systems Policy Directive 
4300A 
provides
 specific DHS technical 
policy reg
arding the use and proper configuration of firewalls and the management of dial
-up connections and other protocols.
 Sound network security practice dictates that all network connections be identified and 
that 
the 

threats and vulnerabilities associated with
 these connections be analyzed
.  The guidance 
provided in Section 5.4.3, 
Network Connectivity
, specifically 
that 
with regard to ISAs, 
and in 
Attachment N to this Handbook,
 Interconnection Security Agreements
, also applies to 
connections to 
the 
Internet a
nd extranet
s. An 
extranet
 is a private network encompassing that 
portion of an organizations intranet that it chooses to securely share
, via the Internet and the 
public telecommunication system
, with external 
entities, which may include 
suppliers, vendors
, and
 customers
.  An extranet requires security and privacy and may involve firewalls, digital 
certificates, message encryption, and virtual private networks that can tunnel through the public 

network.
 All external connections, including extranets, must be
 identified and documented in the Security 
Plan, the Risk Assessment, and other 
Security Authorization Process 
documentation as 
necessary
.  The risks associated with these connections must be addressed during the 
Security 
Authorization 
Process.
  Additional
ly, external network connections are to be reviewed annually 
by Component personnel and documented in the annual information security assessment.
 Adequate protection requires proper selection and installation of firewalls and other boundary 
devices, Intrus
ion Detection Systems, and ancillary encryption or filtering devices
.  These 
devices must be 
assessed and authorized
 prior to their use on DHS networks
.  Implementation 
guidance for firewalls is discussed in Section 5.4.4
 of this Handbook
, Firewalls
.  Intrusion 
detection 
systems are covered in Section 5.4.2
; encryption is addressed in Section 5.5.1
.  The 
DHS 4300A SENSITIVE 
SYSTEMS 
HANDBOOK
  v12.0, November 15, 2015
 155 adequacy of 
all of 
these must be monitored and reviewed as part of periodic information security 
assessments.
 Firewalls must be configured 
so as to 
prohi
bit any Transport Control Protocol (TCP), UDP 
service, or other protocol that is not explicitly permitted
.  Of particular concern is the need to 
close ports that allow file and printer sharing, whether through Microsoft NetBIOS, Common 

Internet File Servic
e (CIFS), Network File Services (NFS), or TCP Server Message Block 
(SMB) protocols
.  The use of file and printer sharing is associated with numerous vulnerabilities 
related to everything from enumeration of devices and user accounts to anonymous control of
 systems without authorization.
 Telnet, which is prohibited on DHS systems and networks, is a utility program and protocol that 

allows one computer to connect to another computer on a network
.  After providing a username 

and password to login to the remote
 computer, a user can enter commands that will be executed 
as if entered directly from the remote computer
.  Telnet transfers all information in clear text 
(unencrypted 
human
-readable text), which allows Internet service providers (ISPs) and other 
users 
on the Internet, intranet, or LAN to intercept 
and read 
the traffic
.  Telnet use
 could allow 
unauthorized users to get user IDs and passwords, capture information or commands that are 

being sent, and potentially alter the information in the telnet connecti
on.  Telnet uses a 

commonly known port, which makes it easy for someone to sniff telnet traffic
.  The approved 
solution for this functionality is to use SSH
.  SSH is an 
Internet Engineering Task Force (
IETF
) protocol that provides encrypted connections a
nd supports authentication with digital certificates 
and other secure methods of authentication.
 File Transfer Protocol 
(FTP
) is a means of transferring files from one computer to another
.  FTP 
transfers all information in clear text (
unencrypted 
human rea
dable text), which allows Internet 
Service Providers (ISP) and other users on the Internet, intranet, or LAN to intercept the traffic it 
creates
.  This allows unauthorized users to capture information or commands and possibly alter 
the information in the F
TP connection
.  FTP generally uses a commonly known port, which 
makes it easy for someone to sniff FTP traffic
.  The approved solution for this security risk is 
to use the Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) 
element
 of SSH
.  SSH is a FIPS 140
-2-approved
 IETF protocol
, which provides encrypted connections and supports authentication with digital 
certificates and other secure methods of authentication.
 Use of the following is expressly prohibited:
  Telnet
  File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
  Simple Network Manageme
nt Protocol (SNMP), which can be used to monitor and control 
systems
  Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) messages
 The following have significant risks and 
must
 be used only in conjunction with appropriate 
countermeasures and risk

s:  Mail servers, which deliver, forward, and store mail
  Clients, which interface with the user and allow them to read, compose, send, and store

.  If IM and ICQ tools are to be used, they should not 
include or communicate with publicly available IM or ICQ tools provided by several Internet 
providers
.  Any such tools employed need to be capable of blocking any fo
rmat except pure text

and networks.
 Second only to Web server
s, mail servers are the host on a network that is mos
t often targeted by 
intruders
.  Mail servers are targeted because they communicate, to some degree,
 with untrusted 
third parties
.  Additionally, 
email
 has been an effective method of pas
sing malicious co
de

.  As a result, mail servers, mail clients, and the network infrastructure that su
pports 
them must be protected

includes the following steps:
  Apply patches as they become available after first testing them in a lab environment
  Remove or disable unneeded services and applications
  Configure user authentication
  Scan the operating system with a vulnerability assessment to

 account and/or intercept 
emails.
 When a 
Public Key Infrastructure (
PKI
) system is properly integrated into the client email 
facility, it is possible to hash a message to determine that it has not been altered or otherwise 

tampered with
.  It is also poss
ible to encrypt sensitive data in an email using the employees 
digital certificate encryption key and digitally sign an email using the digital certificates signing 

key
.  This establishes integrity, confidentiality, and nonrepudiation with regard to sens
itive 
information.
 The infrastructure that supports the network plays a vital role in the security of the email system
.  The network infrastructure is the first line of defense between the Internet and a mail server
.  Network 
design alone,
 however, cannot 
protect a mail server
.  The following steps need to be 
accomplished on a 
according to a regular schedule
:  Review and analyze log files
  Back up data daily (or in accordance with the

rojan horses)
  Have a recovery plan in the event of a disaster
  Test and apply patches in a timely manner
  Scan the system for vulnerabilities with a vulnerability

 Accounts
 Just as discussing sensitive information on a cell phone in a crowd can expose the information
, sending sensitiv
e email
 to a personal account can expose that information to a large number of 
unauthorized individuals.
 Sending email to a personal account has the following vulnerabilities:
  DHS does not authorize the use of p
ersonally owned computers 
with
in DHS
; they 
 are not 
likely to have the appropriate encryption software installed, 
thus 
information 
is 
sent in clear 
text
  The route 
that 
the email travels cannot be predicted
  Untrusted persons at ISP sites may read sensitive information
  Email travels over unprotected 
communication links
 that 
can be sniffed in transit
, exposing
 messages 
to being 
read by unauthorized 
persons
  Web browsers are often used to access private email accounts
 and s
uch access is inherently 
not secure
  Malware 
(which could exist on the employees
 personal computer) 
can send
 copies of 
existing emails or other text on a victims computer to unknown individuals
  Instant Messaging channels are a frequent source of 
malware 
and 
of

  So-called spyware programs 
transmit information from personal computers to 
unknown 
sites
.  Some
 programs (both freeware and commercial) install these programs to harvest 
marketing information and other information from a users computer.
 Any unauthorized person who acquires sensitiv

 5.4.8 Testing and Vulnerability 
Management 
The
 DHS SOC
 takes a proactiv
e approach to vulnerability management including detecting 
vulnerabilities through testing, reporting through Information System Vulnerability Management 
(ISVM) messages, and conducting Vulnerability Assessments (VA). 
Vulnerability management is a combinat
ion of detection, assessment, and mitigation of 
weakn
esses within a system.  Vulnerabilities may be identified from a number of sources, 
including reviews of previous risk assessments, audit reports, vulnerability lists, security 

advisories, and system security testing such as automated vulnerability scanning or security 

control assessments.
 Core elements of vulnerability management include continuous monitoring and mitigating the 

discovered vulnerabilities, based on a risk management strategy.  This strategy accounts for 

vulnerability severity, threats, and assets at risk.
 The DHS
 ISVM
 Program
, managed through the 
SOC
, provides 
Component 
CISOs/ISSMs
 and 
operational support personnel (e.g., ISSOs, System Administrators) with bulletins, alerts, and 

technical 
advisories related to emerging vulnerabilities and th
reats
.  The ISVM is modeled on the 
Department of Defense Information Assurance Vulnerability 
Assessment
 (IAVA) program but 
generally does not pr
escribe mitigation options nor centrally manage software pa
tching
.  The 
following ISVM tools are available to support the Component

 5.4.8.1 Vulnerability Scanning
 Vulnerability scanning is the process of identifying known vulnerabilities of 
information 
systems 
operating on a 
network 
in order to determine if 
a system can be compromised
.  Vulnerability 
scanning often employs software that contains database
s of known flaws, 
and 
tests systems for 
the occurrence of these flaws
. Vulnerability scanning typically refers to system audi
ts on internal networks that are not 
connected to the Internet, as well as 
to 
systems that are visible on the Internet
.  The
 purpose 
of 
vulnerability scanning 
is to identify weaknesses in a system (or 
in 
system security procedures, 

hardware design, interna
l controls, etc.) that could be exploited to gain unauthorized access
 or to 
affect the systems 
availability or data integrity.
 Staff members performing this type of testing 
must
 be cleared to the levels 
commensurate with 
that of the system
 being tested
. DHS 4300A SENSITIVE 
SYSTEMS 
HANDBOOK
  v12.0, November 15, 2015
 163 5.4.8.2 Expanded Vulnerability Scanning
 The type of security testing performed by general
-purpose vulnerability scanning tools may 
uncover weaknesses in the underlying 
element
s of systems that host DHS
 intranet or Internet 
web sites
.  A special class of scanning to
ols explores weaknesses in 
element
s of web systems for 
vulnerabilities related to the content and functionality of such systems
.  Examples of such 
vulnerabilities include the ability of unauthorized persons to examine or alter files, to establish 
cross
-sit
e scripting (which redirects users of a web site to another web site), or to directly access 
a database from which 
the website draws 
data 
that it displays.
  A similar class of 
database 
vulnerability tools exists for databases
. These tools 
have the capabili
ty of exploring inherent 
and 
design
-induced weaknesses
.  Common vulnerabilities include default passwords that have not 
been removed, authentication bypass errors, and the ability to alter data without authentication.
 Thorough vulnerability scanning expand
s upon the canned tools to include manual testing of 
potentially vulnerable s
ystems and network 
element
s.  For example, firewalls may provide 
barriers to 
standard discovery techniques
.  Specialized scanning tools
, however,
 can u
se normally open ports (e.
g., 80 for 
(HTTP)
) and configurable timing parameters to discover 
internal systems in such a manner that neither a firewall nor a 
(NIDS can detect the scan
.  Such 
vulnerability assessments should also include both war dialing to find unauthorized dial
-in modems, and war driving to detect unauthorized or misconfigured wireless network 

equipment.
 5.4.8.3 Gap Analysis
 Gap analysis determines the variance between requirements current capabilities.  It 
requires that 

the testers have access to internal information su
ch as security policy and procedure documents 
and specific networks or sy
stems that should be assessed
.  Internal staff or, preferably, third 
par
ties can perform gap analyses.
 5.4.8.4 Penetration Testing
 Third
-party personnel who have no knowledge of the security 
policies or the internal structure of 
the network typically perform penetration tests
.  Penetration testing assesses weaknesses of a 
computer facility or network to attack by amateur or profession
al hackers. 
A thorough 
penetration test will include socia
l engineering, dumpster diving, identification of networks 
through public sources (e.g., WhoIs and RwhoIs searches of the Regional Internet Registries) as 

well as manual techniques for finding weak points i
n an organizations perimeter
.  Once internal 
syst
ems have been identified, a search of the NIST 
Internet Categorization of Attacks Toolkit 
(ICAT
) database can provide a laundry list of possible vulnerabilities in the hardware, operating 
systems, middlewar
e, or applications discovered.
 5.4.8.5 Scope of Vulnerabil
ity Assessments
 All equipment attached to the DHS 
information system
 infrastructure is subject to se
curity 
vulnerability scanning
.  In todays changing environment, vulnerable and/or unprotected systems 
can easily be overlooked
.  Systems that are not prope
rly managed can become potential threat
s to 
the hea
lth of the DHS infrastructure.
 Proactive security scanning allows for a meaningful assessment of system security against 

known 
risks, provides
 a roadmap of effective countermeasures for improving s
ecurity
, leads to 
faster detection of vulnerabilities, and reduce
s damage to breached systems
.  Proactive scanning 
can also identify authorized and unauthorized devices on the internal network
, such as 
DHS 4300A SENSITIVE 
SYSTEMS 
HANDBOOK
  v12.0, November 15, 2015
 164 unauthorized wireless access points, modems or high
-speed link
s installed by employees for their 
personal convenience
. Any system identified in conjunction with a security incident 
is subject to 
a comprehensive 
security scan
.  Random network scans 
will
 not be advertised
, but the DHS 
SOC
 will
 be informed 
prior to cond
ucting any scans.
 Network and host scans 
are to
 be conducted by authorized DHS personnel using pre
-designated 
scanning machines in order to be easily recognizable as benig
n activity in system log files
.  Because 
vulnerability scanning can be resource inten
sive, routine scanning is to be done during 
periods of low network activity when feasible.
 5.4.9 Peer
-to-Peer Technology
 Peer
-to-peer technology 
refers to applications that allow 
individual PCs 
to 
act as se
rvers to other 
individual PCs
.  This technology was m
ade
 popular by music file
-swapping service
s (e.g., 
Napster, 
Kazza, etc.)
.  Peer
-to-peer technology allows users to share files with each other 
through a network of computers that use the same
 peer
-to-peer client
.  Each computer has the 
ability to act as a 
both a 
server
, by hosting files for others to download
, and 
a client by searching 
other computers for files the client wants to access.
 This
 technology introduces a significant risk to 
Government
 data and exposes Government 
agencies to legal liabili
ty for cop
yright infringement
.  Use of this technology can also decrease 
productivity and use large amounts of bandwidth.
 Peer
-to-peer applications circumvent most enterprise security systems
.  This provides malicious 
users easy access, allowing them to install malw
are, identify IP addresses
 or 
user names
, launch 
denial of service attack
s, gain control of network resources
, or access sensitive information
. Many peer
-to-peer programs do not allow user
s to control how much of their disk space is 
accessible, potentially
 allowing 
unauthorized persons access to 
files that the user has no intention 
of sharing
. In addition to security concerns, the use of peer
-to-peer technology for its most commonly used 
functions (i.e., sharing music, images, and video) exposes both the in
dividual and DHS to 

criminal prosecution for copyright violations.
 For these reasons, peer
-to-peer software is not authorized on DHS computers or on any computer 
or system that might be connected to the DHS network
.  Use of peer
-to-peer software is 
conside
red an unauthorized use of Government resources and constitutes a reportable security 
incident and 
may 
result in sanctions 
against v
iolat
ors
. [For additional information on inappropriate use of DHS resources, see Section 3.12,

 5.5 Cryptography
 Cryptography is a branch of mathematics that deals with
 the transformation of data
.  Cryptographic t
ransformation converts ordinary text (plaintext) into coded fo
rm (ciphertext) by 
encryption; and ciphertext into plaintext by decryption.
 This science relies on two basic components, namely an algorithm
, for example 
Advanced 
Encryption Standard 
(AES) and a key
.  The algorithm is the mathematical function used for 
enc
ryption or decryption, and the key is the parameter used in the transformation.
 
The two basic types of cryptography are: secret key systems (also called symmetric key systems) 
and public key systems (also called asymmetric key systems)
.   In secret key sys
tems, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption; that is, all parties 
participating in the communication share a single key that must be securely distributed and 

protected.
 DHS 4300A SENSITIVE 
SYSTEMS 
HANDBOOK
  v12.0, November 15, 2015
 166 In public key systems, each user is assigned his own pair of uniquely
 related keys: a private key 
known only to the key pairs ow
ner, and a public key that can be made publically available
.  Unlike secret key systems, the only keys that need to be shared are the public keys
.   The two keys are mathematically related, but th
e private key cannot be determined from the 
public key and the public key cannot be determined from the private key.
 Encryption using a public key system works as follows:
 1. The originator encrypts the communication for each intended recipient using each 
rec
ipients
 public key
.  A unique
 cyphertext 
is created for each intended recipient
; the 
encryption 
is done by the PKI system and is transparent to the user.)
 2. The encrypted message is sent to each recipient.
 3. Each intended recipient uses his unique private key
 to decrypt the communication
.  This 
is done by the system and is transparent to the user.
 Refer to NIST SP 800
-21, 
Guideline for Implementing Cryptography in the Federal 
Government,
 for more in
-depth information on cryptography.
 Digital signatures are i
mplemented through a public key system
.  A digital signature is an 
electronic analogue of a written signature
.  Like a written signature, it can be used to (digitally) 
sign messages, but has added advantages
.  Advantages include:
  Proving that the originato
r signed the message
  Determining whether or not the message was altered after it was signed
  Remotely authenticating a users identity for access control
  Signatures may be generated for stored data and applications so that the integrity of the 

data and appl
ications may be verified at any later time.

 A PKI is an architected set of systems and services that provide a foundation for enabling the use 
of public key cryptography.  This is necessary in order to implement strong security services and 
to allow the use of digital signatures.
 The principal componen
ts of a PKI are the public key certificates, 
Registration 
Authorities (RA), 
Certification
 Authorities (CA), directory, 
Certificate 
Revocation 
Lists (CRL), and a governing

 5.5.3 Public Key/Private Key
 A public key certificate is used to obtain subscribers public keys in a trusted manner.  Once a 
certificate is obtained, the public key can be used:
  To encrypt data for that subscriber so that only that subscriber can decrypt it
  To verify that digitally signed data was signed by that subscriber, thereby authenticating the 
identity of the signing subscriber, and the integrity of the signed data
 A public
 key/private key pair 
validated in accordance with Federal Information Processing 
Standard (
FIPS
) 140-1 is generated in a hardware or software cryptographic module 
as part of 
the PKI registration process
 and is under the control of the subscriber
.  The pri
vate signing key 
remains under the sole possession of the subscriber
; it is escrowed by the CA and may be 
securely recovered if it is lost or corrupted
.  This 
practice 
allows previously encrypted data to be 
decrypted by the subscriber.

 5.6 Malware
 Protection
 There a
re a number of programs that are
 classified as malicious code, or malware. These 
programs are referred to as 
viruses, logic bombs, worms, Trojan horses, and other names.  
This 
section covers types of malware.
 5.6.1 Types of Malware 
Various types of malware are
 defined in the following table: 
DHS 4300A SENSITIVE 
SYSTEMS 
HANDBOOK
  v12.0, November 15, 2015
 172 Virus
  A virus is a self
-replicating malicious program segment that attaches itself to 
legitimate application programs, operating system commands, or other executable system 
element
s and spreads from one system to another
.  Another definition for virus is: 
a program 
or piece of code that is loaded onto a computer without the users knowledge and runs against 

the users wishes
.  As it spreads, it is said to be 
infecting
 the system.
 Worms
  Worms are malicious programs that c
opy themselves from system to system, rather than 
infiltrating legitimate files
.  For example, a mass
-mailing email worm is a worm that sends copies of 
itself via email
.  A network worm makes copies of itself throughout a network or through file shares
.  Worms often contain Trojan horse or backdoor programs.
 Logic Bombs
  A logic bomb can be defined as dormant code, the activation of which is triggered by a 
predetermined time or event
.  For example, a logic bomb might start erasing data files when the sys
tem 
clock reaches a certain date or when 
an 
application has been loaded X number of times.
 Trojan Horses
  A Trojan horse is a computer program that is apparently or actually useful but 
performs another function
 covertly
.  A Trojan horse generally provides
 remote access to an 
unauthorized person
.  A Trojan horse can be used to modify databases, write checks, send email, or 
destroy files
.  It could be imbedded by a programmer or downloaded from the Internet.
 Web Bugs
  A web bug is executable code included i
n an image (as small as one pixel) that can 
disrupt the operation of a system or acquire and transmit information from a system without the s 
knowledge 
of users who 
merely visit a malicious or compromised 
(bugged) 
web site.
 Backdoor
  A backdoor is a metho
d of bypassing 
a systems security controls
.  The backdoor may 
take the form of an installed program or could be a modification to an existing program or hardware 
device.
 5.6.2 How Malware Affects Systems
 Malware 
pose
s a significant threat to DHS systems
 theref
ore,
 it is essential that all systems 
employ 
preventive 
measures commensurate with the level of risk identified in the risk analysis
.  What makes malware 
unique 
is that 
it can spread from program to program and from system to 
system
 without direct human in
tervention
. Systems that can be accessed by DHS
-approved browser configurations should be categorized 
(trusted, untrusted, etc.)
.  Users 
must
 not 
deploy Web browsers out of the box, since the 
security policies implemented in such tools tend to reflect ve
ndor interests 
that do not 
coincide 
with DHS
 interests
. 5.6.3 Procedures When Malware Is Detected 
On a System
 If malware is detected, the LAN/system administrator is responsible for taking appropriate 

actions
, including
:  Running disinfectors available with antiv
irus software
  Scanning backup
s for 
malware 
prior to restoring system applications and data files
  Checking for re
-infection from media
 overlooked
 during the eradication process
  Using incident reporting procedures described in Section 4.9 to 
notify the ISSO 
of the 
security incident
.     Once the malicious code has been eradicated, the system 
administrator determine
s the extent 
of the damage and restores
 the cleaned programs and files to the disinfected system.

5.7 Product Assurance
 Information Assurance (IA) involves protecting and defending information and information 
systems by ensuring their confidentiality, integrity, 
availability, authentication, and 

nonrepudiation.  Information assurance is achieved through the use of IA and IA-
enabled 
products. 
The National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) 
is 
a collaborative effort by 
NIST
 and 
the NSA
 designed to meet the security testing, evaluation, and assessment needs of both 
information system
 producers an
d consumers
.  NIAP combines the extensive security experience 
of both agencies to promote the development of technically sound security requirements for 
information system
 products and appropriate metrics for evaluating those products and systems. 
The NIAP
 Common Criteria Evaluation and Validation Scheme 
(CCEVS)
 for information 
security  is a partnership between the public and private sectors, to evaluate 
information system
 product conformance to international standards.  
The scheme is designed
 to help cons
umers 
select products that meet their security requirements 
while helping the 
manufacturers of those 

products gain acceptance in the global marketplace.
 Compliance with th
e DHS 4300A Policy Directive, coupled with the 
requirement 
that products 
have been ap
propriately validated by designated Federal authorities and 
by CCEVS,
 will reduce 
costs and remove the burden of maintaining and providing interoperability between numerous 

software systems 
custom written 
by 
various 
contractors.

 175 5.8 Supply Chain
 Both the public and pri
vate sectors generally recognize that much of the trustworthiness 
challenge facing commercial 
Information and 
Communications 
Technology (ICT), 
including 
hardware
, software, and services, stems from decisions made by suppliers.  Weaknesses exist in 
commerci
al ICT product development and in the underlying business systems that produce them, 
but more importantly, acquirers are accepting risks that result from these weaknesses on behalf 
of the end user without providing the information needed to assess the risk
 themselves.  These 
supply chain weaknesses, and the costs of not reducing the consequent risks, become the burden 

of the end user. 
 Components assign an 
impact level (high, moderate, low) to each security objective 

(confidentiality, integrity, and availab
ility) for each DHS information system
, applying 
NIST SP 

800-161 controls tailored specifically to the security objective at the determined impact level.
 NIST SP 800
-161security controls
 are implemented by use of 
the FIPS Pub 200, 
Minimum Security 
Require
ments for Federal Information and Information Systems
 methodology, based on the FIPS 199 
impact level established for each separate security objective (confidentiality, integrity, availability).
 Supply chain risk mitigation activities can take place at an
y time during a systems lifecycle, but 
the opportunity to influence the trustworthiness of the systems commercial ICT products and 
services is greatest during acquisition and in preparation for milestone reviews.  At these times, 
supplier business risks 
and rewards are greatest.  Even procurements associated with operational 
support and system retirement offer an opportunity to mitigate supply chain risk.  A strategy to 
manage supply chain risks must include the following actions:
 1) Development and imple
mentation of supply chain risk management strategies at the 
enterprise, component, division, department, and operational level of each system.
 2) Education and training of DHS staff and contractors about supply chain risks, and about 
each persons role in 
managing that risk.
 3) Enforcement of good DHS supply chain hygiene, and extension of this enforcement to 
suppliers by establishing contractual requirements and audit mechanisms to enforce those 

requirements.
 Future policy revisions will integrate these ac
tions into existing and new requirements, 
particularly with regard to accountability for identification and mitigation of supply chain risk. 
Opportunities for SCRM education and training, as well as for broad awareness of supply chain 

hygiene, will be the 
manifest response to the implementation of this strategy.
 5.8.1 Business Impact
 DHS depends on numerous external supply chains for its ICT needs.  Many of these supply 
chains are independent of one another, and come with their own risks.  It is often no longer 

enough for acquisitions staff to perform due diligence at the beginning of an acquisition. 
Effective Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) requires the analysis of a Business Impact 

Assessment (BIA) to determine if the supply chain risks represent unacceptabl
e business or 
mission impact and to propose cost effective counter
-measures.
 A BIA is most effective at the point in the system acquisition and development lifecycle at which 

enough is known about the operating environment and interconnections, major compo
nents and 
DHS 4300A SENSITIVE 
SYSTEMS 
HANDBOOK

 176 services, and the allocation of government and contractor responsibilities to determine the 
likelihood of harm to the enterprise.
 5.8.2 SCRM Plans
 All DHS organizations that acquire, develop, and operate sensitive systems require a SCRM 

Plan.  There ar
e three tiers of SCRM governance, two of which require SCRM plans:
  Tier 1:  Governance as DHS Sensitive Systems Policy Directive 4300A, defining the 
SCRM policy for the DHS enterprise;
  Tier 2:  SCRM plans that consist of a Components specific guidance
 to mission and 
business owners who may supplement this component guidance as to the recommended controls 

and countermeasures;
  Tier 3:  SCRM plans at the level of individual systems or programs, such plans either 
standing alone, or incorporated into the 
systems security plan.
  These three SCRM governance tiers are shown in Figure 5.8
-1.  Figure 5.8
-1. SCRM Plan Tiers
  5.8.2.1 SCRM Plan Framework
 SCRM plans should cover the full lifecycle of systems and programs, addressing acquisition, 
development, operations, 
sustainment, and termination or disposal.  Plans should include, as 
DHS 4300A SENSITIVE 
SYSTEMS 
HANDBOOK
  v12.0, November 15, 2015
 177 attachments, relevant agreements provided by system integrators, suppliers, and external service 
providers as part of the contracting process.  Such agreements, which can also be referred 
to as 

supplier SCRM Plans, may describe details of risk management activities performed on behalf of 

the end user by supply chain participants.
 These agreements are typically reflected in plans submitted as a contractual deliverable and 

included in Tier 3 
SCRM plans, but may also be included in Tier 2 SCRM Plans for acquisitions 

that span multiple systems.  Review and update SCRM Plans on a schedule that coincides with 

lifecycle milestones or control gate reviews and significant contracting activities.

 179  5.8.2.2 SCRM Plan Sections
 Structure of an SCRM Plan should have nine (9) numbered sections as given below.  
  1. Introduction
 Describe th
e purpose of the SCRM Plan. Tier 2 Plans may need to be derived, in whole or in 
part, from existing policies or other guidance. Tier 3 Plans may be closely tied to or integrated 
with Security Plans (SP) but may also be retained as stand
-alone documents i
n the case of, for 
example, legacy systems with no expected changes to existing documents. These systems still 

require SCRM plans to ensure that supplies, replacement parts, support contracts, etc. comply 

with DHS Sensitive Systems Policy Directive 4300A.
 For all tiers, provide a general statement that conveys the intent of the organizational leadership 

to adhere to the Plan, enforce its controls, and ensure it remains current.
  2. Purpose and Scope
 Include: The name of the Department, Agency, or Component for
 which this Plan applies.
 For Tier 2:
  State a unique identifier given to the mission or business.  This may be the name of an 
acquisition program, an IT acquisition (e.g., one listed in an applicable OMB Exhibit 
300), or any other designator that describes
 the scope of the SCRM Plan at Tier 2.
  Provide a brief explanation of what this mission or business encompasses, including a 
high level summary of systems within the scope of the Plan.
  List all Tier 3 SCRM Plans and/or System Security Plans that are within
 the scope of 
the Tier 2 Plan.
 For Tier 3, if creating a separate SCRM Plan, include a unique identifier and name given to 
the system. (For consideration: List all essential supporting systems and interfaces (such as 

network infrastructure) and their relev
ant SCRM data from their SCRM plans if such a plan 
exists. This provides the opportunity for the Component or Agency to find missing, 

overlapping, and redundant controls.  At minimum, most if not all supporting systems will 

require replacements
, supplies, 
and upgrades.)
  3. Authority
 Include: Authorities and references to relevant DHS and Component documents, such as 

policies, strategic plan(s), acquisition guidelines, processes, procedures, etc. Policies may include 

SCRM 
policy,
 security policy, acquisition p
olicy, and any other policy applicable to the context 

of this SCRM Plan.
 For Tier 2, include the applicable Tier 1 SCRM Plan title.
 For Tier 3, include the applicable Tier 1 and Tier 2 SCRM Plan titles.
  4. Audience
 DHS 4300A SENSITIVE 
SYSTEMS 
HANDBOOK
  v12.0, November 15, 2015
 180 For all three tiers, include all Components
 that should be active participants or interested parties 
in this plan, and that should be using it to influence their activities. These may include legal, 
acquisition, IT security, supply chain and logistics, human resources, finance, etc.; specific 

indiv
idual roles such as CISO
s, procurement personnel, program managers, etc., as appropriate.
  5. Roles and Responsibilities
 For all three tiers, identify by position those responsible for the Plan and identify the key 

contributors to SCRM. 
 a.
 Responsibility for th
e Plan
 State the role and name of the individual or group responsible for the Plan.
  For Tier 2, an example may be Chief Information Officer (CIO), mission or business 
function manager, or Program Manager
  For Tier 3, this is the System Owner and, if integra
ted into the Security Plan, the 
Authorizing Official.
 Include the name, title, organizational affiliation, address, email address, and phone number of 
each person.
 b. Key Contributors
 Identify key contributors to the Plan.
  For Tier 2, an example may be Acquis
ition/Contracting, Operations Manager, System 
Architect
  For Tier 3, an example may be Systems Engineer, Security Engineer, 
and 
Developer
/Maintenance Engineer.
 Include the name, title, organizational affiliation, address, email address, and phone number of 

each person.
 6.  SCRM Controls
  List applicable (per tier) SCRM controls resulting from the Evaluation of Alternatives. 

Description of each control should include the following:
  Title and description
  How the SCRM control is being implemented, or planned to be
 implemented
  Applicable scoping guidance
  Tailoring decisions with justifications
 For Tier 2, reference the applicable Tier 1 SCRM Plan that provides common controls. 
 For Tier 3, reference the applicable Tier 2 SCRM Plan that provides common controls.
  7. Usi
ng and Revising SCRM Plan
 SCRM Plans are living documents that must be updated and communicated to all appropriate 

individuals 
- government staff, contractors, and suppliers.
  a.
 Communicating SCRM Plan
 DHS 4300A SENSITIVE 
SYSTEMS 
HANDBOOK
  v12.0, November 15, 2015
 181 Describe processes by which this SCRM Plan will be commu
nicated to other Tiers to ensure 
supply chain interdependencies are addressed. Examples include:
  Posting on appropriate portal(s)
  Communicating via email
 o Briefing appropriate individuals including those responsible for addressing 
deficiencies
  Including inf
ormation contained in the SCRM Plan in applicable training and outreach 
materials.
  b. Revision and Improvement
 Tiers 1 and 2 SCRM Plans should be reviewed, at a minimum, on an annual basis since changes 
to laws, policies, standards, guidelines, and controls 
are dynamic and evolving.  At a minimum, 

review and update Tier 3 SCRM plans at lifecycle milestones, gate reviews, and significant 
contracting activities, and verify compliance with upper tier plans as appropriate.
 State the required frequency for SCRM Pl
an reviews to consider updates. Define criteria that 
would trigger SCRM Plan revisions. These may include:
  Change of authorities that apply to the plan
  Change of policies that apply to the plan
  Significant SCRM events
  Introduction of new technologies
  SCRM 
plan shortcomings
  For Tiers 2 and 3, change in the governing SCRM plan for the Tiers above
  Change of scope
  Other Component
 -specific criteria
 SCRM Plan owners can use an SCRM Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) to assess the 

impact of the changes and gui
de SCRM Plan revisions and to ensure that the updated Plan does 
not leave a gap in coverage from the previous version. Describe SCRM POA&M process and 
resolution steps.
 c. Implementing and Assessing Effectiveness of SCRM Plan
 Components should use their SCRM 
Plans during budgeting and planning processes,
 particularly 

with respect to acquisition and procurement activities.  Operations staff who procure replacement 

parts and ancillary services and who may not be aware of the potential supply chain risks 

associat
ed with such procurements must also adhere to applicable SCRM plans.  Each tiers 
SCRM Plan should describe SCRM monitoring and enforcement activities (including auditing, if 

appropriate) applicable to the scope of each specific Plan.
 If appropriate, SCRM 
Plan owners may decide to use qualitative or quantitative measures to 

support implementation of the Plan and to assess effectiveness of this implementation. If such 

measures are used, they should be stated in the Plan.
 Supplier
-provided plans associated wi
th Tier 3 systems should be included if such plans are part 
of contractual agreements. 
 DHS 4300A SENSITIVE 
SYSTEMS 
HANDBOOK
  v12.0, November 15, 2015
 182 Describe general details about the use of the SCRM Plan, such as when to initiate collaboration 
with engineering and contracting activities, the condition under which a
n SCRM Plan audit is 
performed, and permissible steps to enforce the conditions of the SCRM Plan.
  8. Use of SCRM Plans during Contingencies and Emergencies
 This paragraph is optional.  Components should decide whether to use it depending on mission 
criticali
ty, applicable threats, and other factors.
 In the event of contingency or emergency operations, the Component may need to bypass normal 

acquisition processes in the interest of mission continuity.  Contracting activities that are not 

vetted using approved 
SCRM Plan processes introduce unknown risk to the enterprise.
 When appropriate at Tier 1, 2, or 3, describe abbreviated acquisition procedures to be followed 

during contingencies and emergencies, such as the contact information for SCRM subject matter 

expe
rts, who can provide advice in the absence of a formal tasking and approval.
 For Tier 1, describe Component procedures and waiver processes.
 For Tier 2, describe mission 
and business
 procedures and waiver processes in addition to those 
included in Tier 1.
 
For Tier 3, describe system
-specific procedures and waiver processes in addition to those 
required by Tiers 1 and 2.
  9. Attachments
 For Tier 2, attach or provide links to applicable Tier 3 plans.
 For Tier 3, attach or provide links to applicable plans for es
sential supporting systems.
 For Tier 3, attach applicable contractual agreements or SCRM plans provided by contractors or 
suppliers.
  No prescriptive set of mitigations can be provided; rather, it is necessary for 
each DHS 
organization
 to consider the rang
e of countermeasures that could be selected.  Table 
10 provides 
some general recommendations.  It is up to individual Components to establish their appropriate 

supply chain risk reduction strategies and to determine the best ways to implement them.
