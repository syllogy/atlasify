# Atlasify

This repository contains a collection of open-source code around C2 Labs and our Atlasity product.  Each subfolder contains a separate project which includes:

- Integrations with third party systems
- Parsers for data ingest

## Purpose

As C2 Labs Professional Services or 3rd party collaborators create integrations with Atlasity, we intend to publish these integrations freely as open source for use by our customers.  In this way, we can continue to increase the value of Atlasity by leveragin the power of our ecosystem.

## Current Integrations

Check back often as our list of example code for integrations is expanding rapidly:

- Parser for NIST 800-171
- OSCAL Parser for NIST 800-53 Rev5
- Integration for JIRA
- Parser for CMMC with Objectives
- Parser for NIST Privacy Framework
- Integration with Wiz.io
- OSCAL SSP Importer for GovReady
